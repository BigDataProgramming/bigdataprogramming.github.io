## About the Book
The book Programming Big Data Applications introduces and discusses models, programming frameworks and algorithms to process and analyze large amounts of data. In particular, the book provides an in-depth description of the properties and mechanisms of the main programming paradigms for Big Data analysis, including MapReduce, workflow, BSP, message passing, and SQL-like.

Through programming examples it also describes the most used frameworks for Big Data analysis like Hadoop, Spark, MPI, Hive, Storm and others. We discuss and compare the different systems by highlighting the main features of each of them, their diffusion (both within their community of developers and users), and their main advantages and disadvantages in implementing Big Data analysis applications.

## Usage
Users are free to download and use this code. To facilitate usage, a README.md file has been included in the folder of each exercise, providing details about the code and explaining how to run it in the distributed environment. Additionally, each exercise folder includes a bash script, run.sh, that automates the process of building, setting up, and running the example.

A guide on how to run the code of the different exercises is available here: https://bigdataprogramming.github.io/
