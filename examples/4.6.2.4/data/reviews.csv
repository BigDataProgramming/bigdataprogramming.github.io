1	Poor quality
2	The shoes are very cute, but after the 2nd day of wearing them the tongue started ripping. After the 3rd day of wearing them the plastic on the side ripped. They could have ripped bc I was wearing them to work and I do a lot of walking at work. If you’re going to buy these I don’t recommend wearing them on days where you will do a lot of walking or they might rip
3	Good quality
4	Great
5	Great quality and comfort shoesI was so thrilled when I got my new shoes last week! I had bought a pair of a RAVON shoes over two years ago at an expensive shoe store and I did not regret spending the money because they were perfect walking shoes and they gave me plenty of support and I have a bunion on my left big toe and I had plenty of room for that foot. Tmy new ones just like my old pair as far as being comfortable and they keepI got me balanced. By the way my original pair that are 2 1/2 years old are still good but I am using them to mow grass in because I feel safe walking in them. I wanted new ones because I needed some pretty ones that weren’t grungy looking. I am 67And being balanced is ver  important to me. I highly recommend these shoes because of the wonderful quality and comfort and I got them on sale! What a deal so I feel like I won the lottery! Also I neglected to mention they are very classy looking. Very well-made and beautiful and striking.
6	I would NOT recommend these for running. They have zero support and I could feel the rocks in the ground through the shoe. They are also shaped really weird. The sole protrudes out in the back all around the heel and makes your foot appear much larger than it should.
7	These shoes are cute online but in person...not so much.The shoe is super light weight and flimsy feeling.  Because of this, it feels as if there is no support/stability.My partial orthotic fit well into the heel of the shoe.The shoe not only has aqua-colored accents (shoe string eyelets) but also has an aqua liner throughout the shoe. As I was slipping my socked foot into the shoe for the first time, that inner liner sort of bunched up and made the shoe top look distorted. As if the liner pushed forward and down causing the upper portion and toe of the shoe to twist upward.  Not a nice look.  At that point I decided that I didn't want to struggle with getting the shoe on each time.  I'm returning them.
8	Very comfortable! Absolutely love the look and feel of these shoes. They run slightly too big. But, that doesn't take away from the comfort. I'm not sliding around inside them. I'm able to work in them well and workout in them great. Excellent pair of shoes.
9	I like the style and weight of this shoe, just right for wearing all day.  Good quality components.  However, as other reviewers have said, the insole makes wearing these shoes impossible.  The surface of the insoles is some attractive suede fabric which looks like it will be very comfortable.  In fact, the fabric prevents your foot from sliding into the shoe.  I forced my feet in and my toes were uncomfortably turned in on them selves, I could not possibly wear these shoes like that.  I tried stockings and different types of socks with the same difficulty, I just could not push my foot smoothly into the shoe.  Then I tried taking the insole out of another pair of sneakers and putting them in the Aragon’s.  My foot slid right in but when I walked there was no arch support.  Dilemma, should I send them back or go buy 6 or 7 sets of insoles at the drug store to see if any of them will work.  So disappointing.
10	The tongue is long, stiff, and rough. It rubs my ankles raw.
11	"I have been trying to find a casual, but not too casual, shoe for work. I wanted an athletic shoe fit in a shoe that doesn't look like an athletic shoe. This is pretty close. It works well with chinos or colored denim. They would not look right with ""dress"" pants, but for business casual, it's good. I'm always between 8 and 8.5. I went with an 8 and they fit perfectly.  I also need good support and these are reasonable. I have another pair of Aravon shoes (mary jane) and they also work well. I think this is good brand."
12	I thought they were really cute and fit good but after I decided to wear them around for a day I mopped the floor like I Do every day and I almost slipped so the shoes will not be good for me and my lifestyle very slippery pretty much no tread it would be good for walking as long as you’re never honest with Service but I wouldn’t want to take my chances so back to Searching for a new pair of shoes
13	I'd give them 5 stars if it weren't for the fact that the material on the inside of the shoe keeps pulling on my socks, it's not all the time, but it's frequent enough with certain socks that it becomes annoying to have to stop and pull my socks up which find their way down into my shoes after walking for 10-15 min, also the laces don't seem to stay tied, my recommendation is to buy socks that are really snug around your ankles and use a different pair of laces.... besides that, I think the shoes are really cute, love the choice of brown and blue, I think they work well together, also the shoe has pretty good support, I use my own inserts which fit well in the shoe, but like I said if you don't, the original inserts are pretty good
14	I bought these as a birthday present for myself. I originally wanted to use them as my new jogging shoes. The tongue of the shoe is just too stiff for that though. I am still happy with the shoes cuz they are super cute. Besides the stiff tongue my only other complaint is they seem a tad larger than my other size tens. I have a little more space than I like to have. Otherwise completely awesome!
15	I was so excited to find these shoes. They are super cute!  They were too small, however, and I cannot find the larger size I need.  When I tried them on, they were really stiff and a bit tight.  Who knows maybe they would stretch out as I wore them, but they just didn't fit.  I am disappointed that I can't find the size I need anywhere, but will keep looking.
16	It's a very comfortable and lightweight shoe.  I found it to be pretty true for a size 10, but all shoes run differently.  Other reviews said it ran small, but I didn't find that the case. I bought the 10D width.  The wider width doesn't look odd, it fits the shoe well and my foot.
17	Two years ago I bought this same exact shoes.  I wore them always when choosing a stylish athletic shoe. Originally I bought them when our family was going to go to The Ark in Kentucky and knew we would be doing alot of walking.there has never been a time that my feet hurt when I wear these shoes. And I get compliments often as to how cute they look.  So best shoes for me for comfort and style! Bought them again to update and bought an additional pair in black.
18	Grandson couldn't even get them on, they are so tightly cut.
19	The laces broke after slightly over one week of use. Horrible quality. Before it broke, my son complained it was very uncomfortable, as the metal grommets on the sides rub against the side of his foot.
20	These shoes are cute and jus fine. I wanted to comment on the company actually. I bought these for a wedding for my son to wear and they weren’t going to arrive in time.  I reached out to Amazon with no luck. I finally contacted the company directly and they said they didn’t think they could get them to me in time because of how the process works. However, I literally received these the very next day. Whoever I spoke to, thank you, you obviously went out of your way to get these pulled and shipped to me and I can’t thank you enough. They made it on time and the wedding was gorgeous!!My son kept the shoes on all night and now wears them when he wants to dress up casual  ..he says they are comfy and shoe laces are long enough he can tie them easily
21	When my 8 year old asked for “skate shoes”, I could only picture AirWalks or Vans (which are cute, but don’t fit their wide feet well). I began searching and found these. They are not just skate shoes, but also adorable and good, Adidas quality.
22	Great looking shoe at a great price! I got these in the gray with black stripes and the black with white stripes. Looks exactly like the ones I got from the store that were $20 more. They run big. I wear a women’s 7 in most shoes. I measured my foot on the big kids Adidas size chart and according to it, I should get a 6.5. I got the 6 because they didn’t have any other sizes and based on other reviews from women I was hoping they would work out. They’re big. I measured them against the men’s 7 I had from the store and there wasn’t much difference between the 6 and 7. They measured the same as the men’s 6.5 I had from the store. I would’ve ordered a 5 if they were available. It’s hard to guess with the weird sizing situation. Hopefully putting in some insoles will help because I want to keep them.
23	Very nice shoes. Got them when they were on sale and they are really nice.
24	The shoes fit as expected. I bought these for my seven year old son. He loves how comfortable they are. Definitely worth the buy!
25	Kid loves them. Good fit and comfortable.
26	These shoes fit well and are comfortable.
27	My son likes it. However he said it's heavy. Other than that, it's a great shoe.
28	Brought these for my grandson,  and I'm told it fits him perfectly and he loves them.  He don't ever want to take them off.
29	It’s a tight fit! The top part doesn’t open so it made  it super hard for my son to get the shoe on. We ended up returning the shoes! If #Puma will make it so that the top part can open and then possible Velcro closed or maybe zipper it would be awesome so kids can easily slide their feet in!!
30	This product fits well but may not be ideal for a child that has wide feet. The strap across the top has some stretch but it is very thick and does not stretch easily which may make it difficult for a wider foot to get pass that section. The entire shoe is made very well.
31	Difficult to put on. They are too hard.
32	My Grandson loves his Puma's and so do I️
33	No complains
34	I order  a size 11 kids size shoes received  and 10 it's very tight on my child foot. elastic  that run across cant expands.  sorry I every purchased  this damn shoes
36	It took me a half hour to get these shoes on. Not practical. I returned the item and am still waiting for my refund.
37	The shoe is responsive and that is good. But it would be better to have longer shoe laces
38	love my running shoes!!
39	These were waaaay smaller than the size they were supposed to be.Cute shoes tho.i bought them for my 6 yr old ,but they fit my 4 yr old.so,if you order them,get them 2 sizes bigger than you usually would get.
40	My daughter was size 7 I ordered a size 9 they were still very tight. I'd say size up 10 they would fit perfectly. They super cute otherwise
41	4 stars for sizing issue. Not true to size at all. They run very small. But after return and requesting 3 sizes bigger, we are pleased. The shoes are cute in person than in pic.
42	Honestly look way better in person does not look super cheap in the bowl detail is very decent
43	real cute but ran small, loved the look but had to return
44	To small for my granddaughter
45	Runs smaller than the actual size.
46	Very cute but they run small. Returned it.
47	Ordered a size 6. Looked like size 3. Was very small. Not very good quality.
48	They were extremely small not true to her size at all. Pretty but no good if it don’t fit.
49	Very poor leather quality. The sneakers are very cute and elegant but have been sitting in my closet for the past months. I don’t see myself wearing them again. I wore them for a couple of weeks and they got soiled, as all shoes do. When I tried to clean them with a damp cloth, which I always do with my soiled leather shoes, I got a discoloration as a result that was even bigger than the initial spot, and nothing can be done about it. It cannot be fixed. Unfortunately, a waste of money.
50	Not leather, inside or out. Really smelly polyurethane smell, too. Got them for $23.00, so I'm keeping them. No wonder one of the reviewers stated that they didn't last.
51	This shoe is a bit too tight and the leather shoelaces shed little pieces of leather! They did include a second pair of cotton laces, which is odd.
52	Super cute shoes. The leather laces are just ridiculous because they shed everywhere, but they send regular laces to change them out.
53	"need to put in an insole that supports a foot I don't like wearing flat shoes so I put my own in. The top of the shoe rubbed really bad on my right foot large toe joint which is my ""good"" foot. My left foot with having had major surgeries didn't have same issue. So I am still healing from 2 bad blisters on the right toe joint a week ago."
54	Great quality leather, narrow fit but length is true to size. They're in new condition but came in tissue in an amazon box, no frye box. the laces seem really long and thick for the shoes but overall they're super cute and a great way to dress up sneakers!
55	I bought these shoes despite the price tag of 140$ because they were exactly my style and when I got them I indeed loved the look, however, the first day I wore the shoes (only for 2 hours) I got a blister the size of a quarter (that have caused me to loose sleep for two days do to pain). If shoes are that pricy there is no reason why they shouldn't be built with comfort or at the very least not cause this amount of pain :(
56	Great fit, but the sole is totally flat and hard, offering very little traction. Odd being able to accidentally slide while wearing a tennis shoe. Thick suede laces are not easy to use.
57	I bought these  June 15. The shoes are either defective or counterfeit, it’s now July 21. The return window closed 7 days agoand unfortunately these tennis shoes created a hole where my toe is. I wore them approximately one hour per day and not every day throughout the month. I’ve bought new balance, even this same style,  for years and never had this happen within the first month. They’re either defective in which case I’d like the manufacturer or seller to return them and replace with a new pair or they’re counterfeit and not made well. I’m hoping Amazon or the seller will get in touch with me so we can rectify the situation. Thank you
58	My son is flat-footed with an overpronation problem. These shoes have helped stabilize that. Plus, he is really rough on shoes, but these hold up ok. By the time he grows out of them, they are pretty demolished, but they last long enough for us.
59	These shoes wore out quickly. Fewer than 3 months and they have a big hole and the soles are separating from the shoe. We bought New Balance from the local NB store and they lasted 7 months. These were disappointing.
60	my kid has very wide feet so sizing is always difficult but these fit true to size in XW. I ordered 4 pairs NB (all in different models in xw) and by far he says these have the best cushioning and support. only wish they had more colors.
61	I bought these for my 9yo in a size 7. I came on here and saw a great deal! I got these for $18! It had to be a mistake. My daughter loves them and says she never wants to take them off they are so comfortable. Mom, it feels like I’m walking on clouds!
62	Just under (2)two months and both left and right soles have split apart! Will never purchase these models of NB. Never had any other issues with the other models. Buy at your own risk and NOT recommend these shoes for the kiddos.
63	I purchased these for my daughter in June.  By the time school started in August they had holes in them.  Keep in mind my daughter was wearing flip flops most of the summer, not tennis shoes. These were not worth the money for less than two months of wear.
64	I bought a pair for daily walking and running (5.5 in big kid as I'm a size 7 in women).  I've yet to experience any pain in my feet. I needed a pair of shoes to support my flat feet and the these definitely do the job. The arches are wonderful on my feet and the shoes are light. They're breathable and super bright! I've gotten many compliments. I plan on purchasing another pair before they run out!
65	Good looking shoe. The previous pair we had of this same shoe lasted for almost a year on a boy who is really rough on shoes. Runs a little large. Great for kids who tend to walk on the insides of their feet. Nice color combination.
66	I'm wearing them now.  There're very light BUT very strong!  I'm not quite sure about this, but I'm pretty sure that on a wet floor, they're more stable when I put weight on them.  I simply don't want to know WITHOUT A DOUBT, because I don't want to get my insurance involved. ;]
67	Excellent
68	Very comfortable and the color is accurate
69	Love it I have nothing bad to say about it.
70	Confy, expectrd size
71	nice color
72	These super cute, casual sneaker that are pretty comfy. I personally would prefer a bit more arch support, but they are still comfy for casual wear.  They look cute with shorts, jean, and casual dresses.  I love the little gold details, like eyelets and on the end of the shoe strings.
73	These are easily the worst shoes I’ve ever owned. I love the print, but they are so uncomfortable. There is padding in the bottom and the back of the shoe, but the back of the shoe pinches my heel. I did buy gel inserts to put in the back of the shoe, and they don’t help. I was hoping that the problem would get better once they were broken in, but I’ve worn them almost daily for 2 weeks and it’s not. I will not be buying another pair of Keds.
74	These are so cute but I had to return them as they were way too stiff and would have caused blisters on my heels for sure. I had red marks just from trying them on. Super bummed because they are so cute.
75	I love these shoes. They are so comfortable!
76	Very cute!!
77	Beautiful and comfortable pair of shoes! I absolutely am obsessed with these!!
78	Very cute but horribly uncomfortable and strange sizing. Narrow in toe area but long and stiff, rubs heel. Returning.
79	I love Keds, they are one of my favorites shoes. I especially luv the cheetah print, that is also my favorite.
80	Perfect Fit ! Look Great! So Comfortable!
81	These are great minus the fact the tongue is sewn to the insides of the shoe...maybe that is a thing they do to cleats but my first experience and makes a little difficult to get on but upside doesn’t come off easy either when untied. So otherwise 5star would have been given!
82	The opening for the shoe is fixed. It doesn’t stretch and the opening is small. So unless you have an extremely petit ankle and foot area then these are nearly impossible to put on.  My 9 year old who is petite couldn’t even get these on after trying a second pair a size larger.  Disheartening considering Adidas cleats are our normal go-to.
83	Daughter loved them. Fit was great and they look great too! Daughter is 12.
84	Shoes fit perfect. You have to break them in though. Overall, great fit and great look.
85	No more blisters
86	I wear a size 9 1/2 fits perfect!
87	Too small. I want to return them for a pair that fit comfortably. Have two bloody blisters now.
88	My wife recently used these every day on our cruise and found them to be excellent for dancing.  They are pretty good looking, too.
89	I read many reviews before I bought these. Since so many people said they run big and my last pair of adidas cloudfoam were pretty big, I went half a size down. I usually wear 8.5 so I ordered an 8. They were a little tight the first couple times I wore them so I would advise just ordering them in your regular size. Luckily they've stretched out a bit so my foot fits in there perfectly now. I just have to wear thin socks. The shoes are super light weight. I've used them for the gym and for running errands. Only thing I don't like is that the bottom of the shoe is too smooth. I'd be scared to wear these on a rainy day.
90	Al mes se dañoNo es buena calidad
91	Nice tough shoe for my play hard grandson to wear with his school uniform. He’s hard on shoes and these are holding up nicely.
92	Great shoes for school
93	I own this shoe in denim, burgundy, pink, mint green and now red. Love them all
94	Loved the shoe - super comfortable. Only problem was the color - kid of a taupe-y grey.  Just a little off for my clothing colors.  Would have been great if it was a true dark charcoal grey - otherwise, straight black always works, but sadly, that was not a color option.
95	Way to narrow, plus the upper was not flexible.
96	Good shoes
97	I've been buying dan post albuquerque boots for several years now and they have been great until now. They have obviously changed the manufacturing to a much lower quality. I usually plan on buying a pair every year. I use my boots pretty hard in the garage for welding and fabricating and so far the albuquerque has taken the beating gracefully. But as soon as I opened the box for the new pair I immediately noticed the difference in quality. I included pictures of the old boot compared with the new one. The heal used to have layers of leather between the layers of sole material (rubber, plastic, poly-blablabla whatever?) It was tacked in to place and provided a sturdy support. The new boot has a chunk of foam like garbage the same as any pair of cheap garbage boot one could buy at Walmart. But they compensate for it by coloring it to look like layers of leather. I did try them on and they just didn't feel the same. The sturdy support I have come to count on has been replaced by a feeling of cheap low quality design compromises in exchange for quick profit. With a history of plantar fasciitus I just can't take the chance of wearing low quality footwear. Sorry Dan post, I gotta move on.
98	I bought these with apprehension having Spine issues and a Spinal Implant Device for Pain. I have been a Wellington and Cowboy type Boot guy for Decades and had to stop wearing because of the high Heel causing lower Back Pain and thought I’d try the Dan Post due to the Reviews. I’ve always been a Justin Boot Guy with my first Justin Boots in 1987 but just sent back a pair after wearing them for 5 hours due to Pain and stitches popping on the  Left Boot, Justin has Issues now for some reason. I received my Dan Post today immediately put them on and WOW they are the most comfortable Cowboy Boot I’ve ever put on my Feet, I went to Walmart and walked for 2 hours and zero Back Pain from a non broken in Cowboy Boot, that’s unheard of and if you’re a Boot Person you know what I’m talking about, some discomfort is expected with new Boots. I have a flat kind of wide Foot and wear a 13 tennis shoe and I ordered the 12 EW because they were a lot cheaper and they fit just fine and in fact I could have worn an 11 1/2 and maybe had my Cobbler stretch them if needed. I’m so happy I snagged these Dan Post Boots and I’m just amazed at the Comfort Level from this type of Boot, I can’t imagine how Insanely Comfortable the Blayde or the Storm Tide would be with the extra cushion. I did have to put in an Insole due to my Right Boot missing one but it didn’t matter, these are just a quality Comfortable Boot.Semper Fidelis
99	"These are comfortable and cushy in the foot. The toe box is narrow at first but you can use a cedar shoe tree to make room in the toes, to open the toe area for a better fit.  I wear a women's 8.5 and the men's size 7 fit well w/ an added 3/4 insert to fill up the space in the heels and add support. These would be great for winter, with the sturdy rubber soles with tread, and warm lining. But the heels were placed at an odd angle on these, so that I kept rocking back on the heels.  I put them on a table and saw the heels do not sit flush on a flat surface. This caused the front part of the heel to dig into the bottom of my foot when wearing, and I was constantly rocking back on the heels.I think this was a defect, so returned them. I read reviews that they now make these with a cheaper 'brushed or suede' type leather,  in the past they were made with a smooth leather, so the boots are no longer an ""oily brown"" as described, but more a reddish brown suede.  I noticed the boots suede leather wrinkled quickly just in trying them on, and I was not nuts about that. One way to fix that is to apply mink oil or red wing leather cream, and this smooths out the nap so they have a smooth leather finish and not suede. Boot manufacturers are swapping out this 'nappy brushed leather or suede' for real smooth leather on many boots, b/c it must be cheaper. Sad b/c the smooth leather looks better and wears longer."
100	I read a review before buying these where the guy noted that he had difficulty getting his heal down into the boot and as a result the fabric at he bottom of the shaft and the top of the heal cup tore.  Dan Post apparently fixed that problem buy adding a leather reenforcement. When I first put them on the left one went on fine but with the right one I had a good deal of difficulty getting my heal past the leather patch and into the heal cup.  It has gotten progressively worse until now I can not get the right one on no matter how hard I try.  Perhaps a boot horn would help but...anyway great boots if you can get them on. Very comfortable.  Not sure what to do at this point...So I contacted amazon and I am returning the original pair.  They sent out a new pair. This is an entirely different boot.  They are at least 1/2 too small.  MUCH narrower especially when viewed form the bottom. The sole is 1/2 narrower.  The Dan Post Tag is a different color (green and yellow as opposed to the black and gold of the original).  The heal seems higher.  Leather is inferior. Weird.  I called Dan Post and they said they are always making design changes.  Looks like I'm just going to get my money back.  Too bad.
101	I've owned over 10 pairs of Dan Post boots. Yes, I'm a big fan of them. I enjoy wearing Western-styled clothes and boots. I'm also a truck driver, and a biker. These boots fit the bill for all of these. Right out of the box, they look great, and are very comfortable. I wear a 12D. I ordered a 12D, and the fit is spot on. No problems at the heel, arch, or toe. They're listed as Waterproof. Haven't put that to the test yet. They're not as heavy as I thought they'd be. Very nice boot, easy to get used to, and looks great. I gave them a good treatment of Leather Honey, to condition the leather, and give them some extra protection. All in all, a great boot. I have no issues with them. They're Dan Post boots---great boots, great quality, and great looks. As I titled this review, if you're considering these boots, buy them. A great all around boot. Lastly, I've read reviews, mentioning that they're made in China. Yes, unfortunately, mine say it, too. Really sad.
102	I've owned these boots for two years and have worn them nearly every day.  From mud to motorcycles in the snow and rain, these boots have done all I've asked and more.  In fact they're still going and I can't stand not wear them because they're incredibly comfortable and just get better looking the more beat up they get.  I like them so much that I just bought a new pair to replace them only because the side seams and piping are starting to blow out and the sole of the heal is ready to hit leather.  I would have them resoled if it were not for the seam coming apart.I've given them 4 stars only because of the seam and piping but the fact that I bought another identical pair tells you that 4 stars is a great rating for me.The only time I don't wear these boots is when I'm working-out or I'm hiking.  Otherwise I wear them everywhere from business travel to working in the field.Pros:The fit is dead on at 9DComfort is excellentWaterproofing is excellentDurability is excellentLooks are excellentCon: The plastic piping and seams come apart before the rest of the boot is worn out. That's the only weak point and I think it's the piping that causes the failure.
103	The shoes themselves are super cute but the box came trashed! I wouldn't say it was beat up during transit either. I was disappointed because they are a gift.
104	Cute shoes but started to stink with her not wearing socks after only a few wears. Very disappointed.
105	They look great on her feet. Really nice shoe. And has withstood the whole summer without looking so beat up. Lol
106	These shoes fit my daughter as hoped, and they are SUPER cute. However, the zippers on the back are unbelievably hard to zip and unzip. I would much rather have bought her shoes that she can put on and take off without needing assistance.
107	These sandals are adorable!! They fit just as expected. Probably not the best shoe for wider feet though as they’re pretty skinny, but work just fine for my step daughter. The back is a little hard to zip up and down but I’m sure it’ll be easier in time. Definitely would buy again.
108	"I bought these for my 4 year old. She absolutely loves them. She wears them every chance she gets and they dont show a lot of ""wear and tear."" They look great with shorts or a skirt/dress."
109	So fashionable. Well crafted.
110	My goodness do we struggle to zip these things up!They are much wider than anticipated.Meh
111	Cutest shoes ever! Exactly as described but cuter in person. They fit according to size!
112	Came in a box from Kmart which was really nice, super cute, and well packaged. Has not tried them on yet but will love them!
113	Lovely slipper..I accidentally ordered wrong size..I'm too far to return.
114	Great buy
115	These shoes were packaged like they cost $100. Cans in a lovely reusable bag, a bracelet and a thank you card. Very nice. Highly recommended.
116	Thought I would love these. I didn't open them right away, so I did a few days ago only to find that they fit about half a size big, and they feel like they're a wide width. Then I notice that the eyelets on the left shoe don't line up so when I tied it up it made it feel weird. I don't usually complain but the price of these was too much for what I received.
117	The shoe is stylish and comfortable. Please do not listen to previous review on sizing up.  I did and regret it. I wear size 8 ordered 8 1/2 and now a little too big.  Order your right size and you will be happy with this product.
118	The shoe is a bit narrower than I expected. They have good heel comfort but no arch support.
119	Love it comfortable and light weight buy them for work
120	They look great and feel good!
121	Comfortable. Size was correct
122	I have worn New Balance shoes for 10+ years now.  I started with New Balance WX1011 and WX1012 Cross trainers for tennis based on recommendation from my local New Balance specialty shop.  WX 1011 and 1012 were light weight mesh, flexible with good lateral support and soles that were not too stiff.  As a replacement shoe, New Balance recommended this 966v3 shoe. This is one of the most uncomfortable shoes I have tried on.  It is stiff, it presses across the toes and causes pain and the soles are too thick and stiff for quick movement on the tennis court.
123	Comfortable fit except for the area at the top lace hole. It is very stiff and rests on the inner ankle bone which causes rubbing and discomfort. Tried tieing at a lower hole but still rubs. Once I figure out how to alleviate this problem I will be happy. Hope in time, it will loosen up.
124	"As mentioned by others, these shoes not only run small but they pinch in the forefoot. Also, the ""fit and finish"" of these shoes is highly disappointing -  the way the tongue is sewn into the shoe leaves a lot to be desired and the extra fabric inside the shoe rubs your feet. Finally, the plastic edge where the lace holes sit is extremely rigid and this same plastic edge also affects the front of your foot when tied.Am definitely returning and looking for a better solution."
125	These are very uncomfortable sneakers.  I bought them a while  ago and thought they just needed more time to break in.  Months later, still feel stiff, heavy, and has some plastic pieces that dig in some spots.  Will have to get rid of these.
126	I loved the colors but sizing runs small. I wear a size 11 normally and was trying to find a wider pair of shoes. These are very tight on my foot and I’m hoping they stretch out a bit when worn in.
127	When I ordered these, the website said 6.5 Medium but at checkout it said 6.5 D. I called Amazon & they said these were 6.5 Medium. They arrived & the box said 6.5 D. That’s too wide for me so I returned them. I have other New Balance tennis shoes that are 6.5B. I’m grateful shipping & return were free. Nice looking shoe.
128	Still battle with fit. Also the black is glittering which looks strange. NO arch support
129	Maybe it’s just this color way but the fit is TERRIBLE. It’s tight mid-foot because of some band on the top but it’s actually loose in the toe box. When shoes fit this bad, I just can not recommend them for anything. Not for basketball, not for working out, not even for walking. Adidas is a great brand but they made a mistake with these shoes. I can only see them working if you have overly narrow feet and you size down them.
130	First, these are good looking shoes, they fit pretty well, and the sole has pretty good grip.  What is extremely disappointing is the cushioning level.  What you see on the side of the shoe is not at all what is actually in the sole cushion.  I was looking forward to the Boost cushioning.  Instead, what you get appears to be less than a 1/4 inch of cushioning.  After playing a few games on a hard court, my knees were extremely sore.  All the cushioning you see around the heel is window dressing.  I would not recommend to anyone who values their joints.
131	"These shoes are awesome and are my new favorites. The Adidas ""boost"" on these are the best cushion I've ever felt to date. They feel really good when walking or running because you can feel the energy returned to your feet from the boost cushion. I want these shoes in a couple of different color-ways and the 3/4 or high top versions. I like the various different textiles/textures. The thick collar around the ankle & achilles looks kinda weird, but I'm used to it & like it now. Kudos to the design team, I would love to see how this shoe was made & put together. 👍🏾👍🏾😎✌🏿"
132	I have worn a 10 D my whole life. These shoes were so narrow I could not get my feet in them. Unless you have a narrow foot I would advise against them
133	gots no soul...grip too slick on indoor courts after only 4-5 wears.  The cushioning is pretty decent but shoes are worthless due to the slickness.  Adidas support was no help other than to suggest giving to a friend. I'm offering it to my enemies instead.  Going back to Nike.
134	This was a gift but was to large for the recipient
135	This was a gift and the recipient loved it
136	Sizes run a little big so I might suggest going half size smaller than your usual but the shoes are so cute I love them
137	A bit wide but classy look
138	they are really comfortable, great to run and lift in. a little loose but they fit length wise.
139	Ok, so normally New Balance shoes run a little small. My normal running shoes are Asics Gel Kayano 11.5 4E width. That is my absolute standard when it comes to fit and feel.When I usually purchase New Balance shoes, I get size 12 4E. Even then, its can be slightly short, but tolerable.  With these shoes, I started with the 12 4E. But man do they run long. The width seemed to be pretty accurate though.So I went with the 11.5 4E instead. They fit almost perfectly, except MAYBE a little long in the toes. However, I believe it were a size down, it would be a little too short.These are absolutely awesome on outdoor pickleball courts. I've easily put on about 20 hours of play on them, and they barely have any wear. I HIGHLY recommend and love them so much, I actually have a 2nd pair as backup.
140	New Balance shoes are the only shoes I wear.  I own about 15 pair.  Always 8 1/2 to 9D.  This is much narrower than all my other shoes, right about where the arch is.  New Balance really screwed up here.  Long time buyers used to be able to find the newer model of a pair of shoes that they like but not any more.  I wish somebody at New Balance would listen to their customers.
141	I wore 1004 4e, 1005 4e. Once NB made the 1006 the toe width got narrow. I figured I’d try these and they were comfortable for a 3 hour match. I don’t know how durable they will be but for now they were worth the money. I’m editing because after 6 weeks these shoes are not durable.
142	I play ALOT of pickleball and platform tennis. Both are tough on shoes. Time will tell about the durability. But from a fit, weight, and mobility standpoint,  these IMO are best in class. I've tried several major brands and the umpteen different models they offer. I even tried other New Balance models. All we're either too rigid, too loose, heavy, etc. Thank goodness for amazons return policy. Not mentioned, they look good too!
143	Attractive style but too narrow and low for my wide, high instep, hammer toed feet. They killed my hammer toe. New Balance is my go to for racquetball and walking sneakers but these are narrower and lower at the toe than the 608s I uaually wear. Should have returned but kept past the return limit trying to break them in. My bad
144	These tennis shoes are working very well. It gives me the advantage I was looking for.
145	I purchased these sneakers in late July.  I have worn them a hand full of times and noted a very foul odor after each use.  I have always played sports and have never had this problem with any other court shoes in the past.  Because I have gone over the return window, I am forced to throw these shoes away and buy a different pair.  I am so disappointed. I paid over $84.00 for these sneakers.
146	So far so good. I’ve only played on them a few times but the fit is good, the cushioning is good and they look great.
147	Feel apart in less than a month of play.
148	Pumas come small and narrow but overall design appears good.
149	I don't recommend first day
150	"After measuring my foot, following the size chart and ordering a 7, I could barely fit my foot in the shoe. Turns out I have an incredibly high instep, so I went a full size up to the 8. Fit like a glove! The arch support was in just the right spot - I've NEVER felt so supported by any boot before, hiking or otherwise. There is comfortable padding on the ankle, so no worry abt clipping a rock and having it knock your bone. Also the weight of these boots is incredible. SO LIGHT!!! I feel like I'm wearing sneakers.The other day I took them for a ""test walk"" through a local stream, and while I stayed mostly on the sandy/muddy bank, I did occasionally walk through the water to see how the waterproofness held up. EXCELLENT! I could feel the coolness of the water but my socks stayed 100% dry.I've gotten lots of compliments already and they are by far the coolest looking hiking boots I've owned. I love that the design is not TOO overly ""outdoorsy"" looking and doesn't have a lot of extra straps in the design (ie. keen or LL Bean  boots).Buy these boots and you won't be sorry!!"
151	Don’t waste your time with these.  So I bought the boots in October of 2019.  Yes they are very comfortable and light, but my boots tore right  where the black part of the bottom seams to the shoe. It’s the area where the foot would flex as you step.  I contacted Vasque Red Wing and they told me they offer a 12 month warranty on any manufacturer defects. Sounds great! They told me they have a defect contract with Amazon to take care of this.  So I then reach out to amazon and they tell me that I’m past my 30 days and that they would pro rate me part of the refund and I would keep the boots and get them fixed myself. Sounds great, but that didn’t happen either, they send me a return label and will refund me 80% of the boot value because it’s considered a late return.  Failure from both companies. The 12 month warranty means nothing from Vasque and Amazon did nothing to help. My suggestion is to buy directly from a retailer. Then you may have a chance with the boot warranty.  It’s a tough pill to swallow for 4 month old boots that are $100+.Update:1/30/2020-  apparently Vasque is having issues with Amazon honoring their 12month defect contract.  Once I got this through for Vasque to understand, they offered me a replacement pair of boots, making good with their warranty.  It was a fight, but I am getting new boots from the manufacturer.
152	Just received bought the eggplant I love this show. Not hiked in it yet though. It has a high arch support, and a padded super comfy heap. So for people with heal pain great shoe. My normal size is 8.5, I ordered a 9 based on reviews that it runs small. Well I now need a 9.5 so asking seller if they will exchange. This is not a shoe for a wide footed person but if you are a regular Vasque purchaser you will know that. I would have given 5 stars but for the hassle of having to exchange and hope I don’t get charged extra because shoe runs small!
153	I am a full time vegetable farmer and my shoes have to go through some serious work throughout the season! For the past three months I’ve had these boots and I’ve really loved them. They’ve got a nice tread that I’m kept quite stable walking on rough terrain all day, but they don’t cake quite so heavily with mud when I am working in wet soil.Like any boot that isn’t a rubber rain boot, they will get moist in the inside if I’m really soaking them in puddles and such, but on wet mornings they stay quite dry when I’m walking through dewy grass. I still usually wear Muck boots in those conditions though.The best thing about these boots is their weight and flexibility. My feet and legs really enjoy the sneaker-like feel to these and I can wear them all day and not feel like I’ve got lead weights on my feet. Additionally, they’ve been super easy to hose off at the end of the day.Finally, I’ve been working in 90+ degree days in these and when I’m wearing my summer weight socks, I’m not get boiling hot feet. So that’s a huge plus.Just remember to size up! I was worried that even when I sized up they were a little snug around the edges of my feet (my feet are a relatively normal width, maybe a tiny bit wide), but after even a day of wearing them, they stretched out some and are my favorite farming boot to date!For reference, I typically am walking 3-5 miles a day on the farm and doing lots of bending and crouching. I have yet to see indications of wear at the crease points near the base of my toes from crouching, which is always the first place to “go” in my work boots.So far, they’ve been worth the investment! We will see in a few months how they actually hold up to eastern PA farming.
154	I want to love these shoes, but there's one MAJOR flaw with the design of these shoes witch make these a dealbreaker for me. I've been hiking for years, and I know from experience this design flaw puts you at higher risk for a sprained or broken ankle.  The tread on the sole around the back outside of the shoe does not extend to the edge, which means, when you lean your anke to the side, there is a point at which the shoe will buckle for lack of support, and you're going down! All that time an money for product development, I'm surprised that this got overlooked. It's a bummer, because these would otherwise be great shoes! If you want an expensive pair of comfortable rugged shoes for walking on flat surfaces, then these would be fine.
155	The first thing to get out of the way with these unusual but incredibly awesome hiking boots is the fit...they literally fit like a glove - snug, and almost unsettling close to the actual shape of my foot.  At first I found them to be too small, that is until I realized they just fit closer to my foot’s natural shape than normal shoes do.  If you’re used to the way American work boots fit (extremely large) you may find these “too small”.  They have a deep heal cup, pretty high arch support, and a slightly more square toe box than normal shoes.  The soles have fantastic grip on rocks, and are pretty much the best combination of cushion without being too vague or soft that I have found in a shoe.  I also like that the sole isn’t overly wedged forward like a running shoe, it gives these boots a really planted feeling in rough terrain.  In fact, after wearing these boots for a couple consecutive long off-trail hikes and then switching to a more normal running shoe, I found it surprisingly difficult to keep my footing in the running shoes, which made me realize how great these boots are at keeping my feet stable.  The lacing system is pretty normal, nothing funky, but I will say that the all black and two military looking colors seem to be the only 3 versions with captive upper eyelets instead of hooks - in my opinion the hooks can be dangerous if not lethal by accidentally snagging the laces from the opposite shoe (giving a momentary “feet tied together type fall)...this is especially dangerous if you plan to be climbing around rocks or in areas where a fall could be disastrous/deadly.I like these boots so much I’m buying a second pair incase they’re discontinued.
156	I have been using Vasque boots for over 20 years with great satisfaction.  Specially the Breeze series that is an exceptional combination between comfort, support and lightweight for hiking in hot weather.These shoes are exceptionally light but offer almost no support.  They are fresh foam based and overly flexible.  I am very disappointed and recommend not buying this product even to walk in the city, let alone for a trail...
157	I read the reviews about the tightness. I don't have wide feet. I wear thick socks too. I went a 1/2 size up like you should on hiking boots. They did seem snug at first but I wore around the house and decided to give them a try. I'm so glad I did. I either got used to them or they did seem to break without discomfort. That first time I realized I could run in them too!. I use these to run on hiking trails and my feet and legs don't get tired. I love these boots/trail runners. FYI, they have a 6mm heel to toe drop.
158	They are cute and very nicely made, but I can't get comfortable in them.
159	I’m a plain clothes police officer and I was looking for comfortable, good looking, daily wear all weather boots. I purchased these to try them out hoping they’d work out. The first day I wore them, I spent 5 hours on my feet at the range  wearing a gun belt and armor, in wet grass and the temperature was around 40 deg F. They were perfect...I couldn’t believe how good they get over the course of the training. I then wore them another 8 or so hours afterwards both during and after work. Overall, these boots are incredibly light, very good arch support, excellent traction, adequate in keeping feet warm during cool temps and all around cushioned enough to be incredibly comfortable during just about any activity. i don’t have any experience with these types of boots, mine is limited to those of the tactical boot variety such as the Adidas GsG9 (original), Blackhawk, Oakley, Viktos, Nike (FSB), and my last were Solomon. These blow them all away in the comfort department, though I know they’re not very comparable. My only advice is I run between an 8.5 and a 9, I bought 9’s, which fit me perfectly but that leads me to believe these run just a tad small. The difference may be negligible to most, but figured I’d mention it. I love wearing these and didn’t realize there were boots out there quite this comfortable.*UPDATE*2 months in of almost daily wear, multiple outdoor range dates, 4 days straight of outdoor training at 8 hrs per day on my feet. These boots are absolutely outstanding, so comfortable, supportive and waterproof...my only gripe is the treads are so good that it’s a little hard to get the mud and grass out of them afterwards...
160	I ordered this shoe for my daughter and it was true to size.  She loved it.  The order was shipped in a timely manner and the price was reasonable.
161	I love these hikers! They are extremely comfortable. I received them the day before my hiking trip and wore them to break them in, they were perfect. I wore them for about nine hours the next day and never felt more comfort. They were comfortable around foot, gave a little bounce back when I walked and great ankle support. I will say if you have a wider foot, this is not for you. I have a narrow to medium foot and at first was afraid of the snugness, but I was able to wear a thick hiking sock and it was fine. I would highly recommend these and will be purchasing more.
162	Perfect fit, great price, happy daughter! I am now making up words to satisfy the minimum word count that is ridiculous.
163	I got these shoes for my daughter who plays volleyball. Great purchase. She loves them. They are comfortable and really excels her game.
164	Great shoes at a great price. Were delivered earlier than expected - which is always a good thing! Amazon is the way to go!
165	I usually wear a Women’s size 7, but I got a 6.5 and they fit perfect. I have these in white size 7 and they run a little large. I would size down half a size. Super cute and comfortable!
166	These are the most ill-fitting Pumas ive ever had. And the laces are more like ribbons than actually shoelaces. I have wider feet but that was never a problem with any other Pumas i've had. I had just got some similar orange platform ones and they were the best ever, these were the worst. Way too tight. i thought it was just me at first but then i didnt wear them for a while, and nothing else hurt my feet. Then i just thought i'd need to break them in, but i walked 10 painful miles at least in them over the past two months and my feet still hurt from wearing them two days ago. Nice color but shitty laces and too narrow.
167	Firstly the package when getting these shoes  is phenomenal. IT is a box within another box. Very secure. Open feeling the shoes you notice it's great quality. You can feel the laces are a step up from regular laces. I usually wear 9 but got a 9 1/2 due to shoes being a little narrow due to passed experiences. But the shoe fits to perfection and I got black to use more often . I absolutely love them ! Super nice and the platform helps with confidence and it's slightly curved but it works well for back.
168	Don’t know how to say, can’t tell it’s true or fake product , that’s why gave 4 stars, but it’s heavier than regular sneakers, it makes you look cool whatever style you are in, and color is way light than in the display picture, overall just wearing a regular branded sneaker which don’t know true or fake.
169	These shoes are adorable and the touches like the suede and ribbon laces make them stand out without being obnoxious. But the platform is made of concrete, I think? At least, it feels like I'm walking with bricks on my feet. There's no flex at all and zero cushion. I'd say buy a size up and put an insert in, but they run kind of big, and even an insert wouldn't make up for the fact that the shoes will not allow your foot to bend at all.
170	I gave these shoes a three star because they are stylish and fit. However they are extremely uncomfortable to walk in. The built in insole feels like its designed to make your feet hurt. It would be fine If you could remove the insole it comes with but not only is it sewn in, its glued in as well, so to try and take it out your self would ruin the shoe. if you really want the shoe. Buy a size up and put a thick insole in and that will solve the problem. If you don't feel like going through that don't get the shoe.
171	Love the shoes, hate the packaging from Amazon! This may be small to others, but I keep my boxes for all my shoes and Amazon shipped my shoes in a plastic bag instead of a box. When I received the shoes my box was destroyed.
172	I wear a women's size 12 US which generally translates to a men's size 10. After reading the reviews, I ordered a 10.5 and I could not be happier! I love the look of these shoes. I removed the laces. Since the shoe fits like a sock and I don't plan on running in them, I didn't really see a point of having the laces there. Plus they kinda rubbed my foot in a weird way. They feel absolutely perfect without laces. I have a rather narrow foot. If you have a wide foot, I don't think you would find this shoe to your liking. The grey color is perfect for me and I love the little splashes on the tread at the side. I also love the weave look of the shoe. Overall, a great shoe at a great price!
173	"Ive own two other HyperGEL-KAN shoes and I love them all. These shoes breathe easily and feel great once you break them in. I wear these daily. People say they run a bit small but I think for being being ""athletic"" shoes they fit different. So you should go one size bigger and give them a try."
174	Very comfortable. I thought they were too small vertically at first, but after breaking them in they are very comfortable.Only good for running on flat surfaces, no ankle support. Tried running on a trail and rolled ankle within 30 seconds.
175	I did buy a size up due to previous reviews and I am glad I did. Shoes are very comfortable. I have a lot of issue with my arches and the balls of my feet but while wearing these shoes I have had no pain.
176	It was time for some new shoes so these were chosen. Great quality shoe and very comfortable. I took the shoelaces out for extra comfort and notice the fabric giving me more flexibility. Love these shoes!
177	Amazing shoe. Very comfortable. My size is a 10 would recommend a 10.5 or even 11 if you have a wide foot. I got an 11 and fits me great and feels good.
178	Top collar was to tight to get my foot inside the shoe!! That was with the laces loosened all the way !!Returned them for refund
179	This shoe is well built, one of the best looking hiking shoes I came across, above average quality and really slick design. It's a bit heavy, but it's a waterproof (GORE-TEX) hiking shoe with thick sole, so it's expected.Unfortunately, did not work for me.  Going half size up was a good decision, but the shoe feels tight around the arch, and quite rigid around the inner part of the ankle which makes it really uncomfortable. To add insult to injury (no pun intended, although I can easily imagine injuries at pressure points after long hikes), it really cuts bad into the foot just proximal to the toes, and only one shoe. Virtually impossible to walk without discomfort. Sadly, no matter how much I liked them, had to return.
180	I loved the shoe but unfortunately didn’t work for me. I apparently needed a wider width so have to go to a specialty store for my shoes.
181	I ordered size 5 in wide, it fits me so perfect, love the design, color, very helpful for me for my 8 hours work at the hospital and it gives me height as well.
182	Love them . Great running shoes
183	I am an avid cyclist and tried to make these shoes work by adjusting my cleats repeatedly and even ordered insoles. They just aren’t comfortable and make my feet hurt and toes go to sleep even though I loosen them and the fit is not tight. Will only use my Sidis now.
184	Love that you can often find expensive cycling gear and reasonable prices on Amazon!  I have a slightly narrow foot and have trouble finding road bike shoes that fit my foot securely and comfortably.  These are perfect and were at least $100 more on many other websites.  Most road bike shoes that fit me are $200+, so I was relieved to snag these from amazon!
185	Love these shoes! Wear them to spin class and they work perfect!
186	Very comfortable
187	Nice pair of cycling shoes.
188	Fake fake fake...
189	The bottom of the shoe is solid and bendy which is great, but the sides and back of the shoe is flimsy and will be a problem around the sides of my feet.
190	Love the solid sole of this light weight shoe but wish I’d bought it a 1/2 size smaller.
191	It’s a good looking stylish shoe, but there is slippage in the heel when walking.
192	I normally wear 7.5.  I had to return and get a 7 which is still a generous fit but works.
193	The toe box is tight but they fit nice as long as you get the right size.  I've already owned a pair of these that I bought in a retail store and they are fantastic.  This is a replacement pair.  Can't even remember how many complements I've gotten, even from total strangers.Just remember to buy the right size LOL.  I clicked on the wrong size when I ordered so the pair I got is too small.  It was my fault though, and I'm going to just give them away to someone who might need them.  Already bought another pair in the right size (although I think they came from a different Amazon seller that time) and they are on the way.
194	Shoes are narrow.
195	Love, super comfortable, as advertised
196	bad quality!!!! dented!!! unvalued shoes!!
197	It’s really comfortable
198	"These sneakers are attractive, lightweight, and the overall construction seems good. I appreciate how the entire sole is rubber and not mostly foam like other kids' sneakers. The sizing (like other sneaker companies) is strange. I usually purchase one or two sizes bigger than what my kids wear in most other shoes. My kids also gravitate to the ""wide"" width even though they don't have wide feet. Those last two things are specific to my kids and how they fit in the sneakers, but once I figured these out, we were set.The reason for the 3 star rating: After cutting the tag off these sneakers and discarding the box when my son gave them the thumbs up, I realized the laces are FIXED and UNADJUSTABLE. There is no way to loosen or tighten them because the tops of the laces are glued to the shoe!After wearing them for a couple days, my son commented on how loose they felt. The elastic is not hefty and they already started to lose elasticity. It would not take much time for them to become way too loose.Finally, I had no choice but to cut the elastic laces out and replace them with different laces. It was still problematic because the top hole (where the original ones were glued) was unusable for the new laces. The sneakers are still somewhat loose because my son can't lace and cinch the new laces as high as he should be able to.Bottom line: these sneakers turned out to be a mess. I've been pleased with New Balance in the past and will continue to purchase their products. BUT, I will absolutely make sure I never purchase sneakers with unadjustable, fixed laces again!"
199	What’s not to love? This may be the BEST shoes for kids! It is my absolute favorite of all the amount of shoes ever purchased for my kids, this is hands down the most amazing pair. It does not require the kids to tie (faster for kids to put on), comfort fit, great colors and design, no snagging on the tongue of shoes nor does it elastic on the “laces” become loose! Even my kids say it’s now their favorite. Wished the shoes industry would make more of these for kids!! The best invention of shoes for kids. You will not regret purchasing!
200	"far too often I find myself writing reviews saying others knew what they were talking about.  My son has fairly narrow feet but after wearing these 1 or 2 times he told me they weren't comfortable and pointed to the end of the 'laces' as hurting.I believe the problem is that the elastic ""laces"" don't adjust very much.  I was able to pull the elastic out there and make a little bit of an adjustment so hopefully we can get SOME wear out of them...wish I could return them though.If your child has wider feet, as mine always have been, you shouldn't even consider this product."
201	we’ve saved ourselves some drama getting ready for school in the morning because these shoes are lightweight and easy to get on and off. Another reviewer said the elastic laces make them a little big, but we haven’t found that to be true in our case- I assume it depends on how they’re sized to your child.We also got a really good deal on these!!
202	My 10 year old son picked these out. They looked really good and fit him well. The only problem is the elastic laces. When he runs, plays or makes a cut, his foot slides out. He really did not like wearing them because he could not play in them. I had to cut out the elastic laces and replace them with regular tennis show laces.
203	These shoes are FANTASTIC!  I have 2 boys who constantly run around with their shoes untied.  These have been a life saver for kids who have not yet learned to tie their shoes.  Plus they are stylish, sturdy, and reasonably priced.  I came back the website just to order more sizes as they grow, don't ever get rid of this product!
204	Super lightweight, nice shoes. The only thing is bc of the elastic laces, they are a little loose if your child has narrow feet. Great price and came quick.
205	These sneakers slip on easily. They were labeled wide width but I don’t find them very wide. They are a full size larger on my son’s foot, but the 10.5 W shoes we have from New Balance are too short! Off sizing. Nice color and quality overall. A lightweight sneaker.
206	These shoes are great for my little guy. They're comfortable and they are really nice looking. He has wide feet and typically has a problem with other shoes. He LOVES these.  I actually didn't know when I purchased them that they were slip ons and didnt have actual laces. This made him even more happy. Great buy!
207	I have never tried New Balance for my 3 almost 4 year old before. He is disabled and stride rites always seem to fit him wide. These little New Balance shoes fit him perfectly. He has room to grow, they are narrow enough that I don't have to purchase special narrow shoes and with the stretchy faux ties he is trying to put them on himself.
208	"2 Things: 1- it is true size (a lot of the shoes on Amazon, may not be , but this is..), so if you are size 8, order 8 not 81/2. 2- They are one of the comfortable ones in maybe hundreds.. because I have had to order more than 20 different models, to finally find this to be only the 2nd one that was as comfy a fit as it looks, plus it is an Adidas, so it is quality.The problem: it was used and the box and inside of it were reallllly bad too, and they lie easily : When I ordered it, it said there was only 1 left(Which I got) , but just before returning them, I checked again, and no messages like that!!!! so my rating applies to ""This particular pair ONLY"" ... BUT THE SHOE IS A GREAT SHOE.."
209	Fits perfect to size and I love the color!
210	the shoes are for man , not for woman, as they say in the description.
211	Everything is okay 🤣
212	I love them I just wish they had them in my size in the white
213	Good looking shoe. The cloud foam cushion it came with took me about five minutes to dislike because your toes roll over the edges and that’s soooo annoying. But determined to want to keep them because they are attractive and slip on (I wanted them for a work from home house shoe.) I put a pair of Dr. Scholls in soles inside them. They’d been in an old pair of sneakers so I could easily give that a try and let me tell you ... it worked splendidly!! I now LOVE these shoes. They are like walking on marshmallows. True to size. Attractive. Super comfy. Downside is that I ran an errand the first day I had them and something was poking me in the foot so I looked and an earring without a back had picked completely through the cheap sole. Not a huge big deal but worth mentioning. I’d say if you’re looking for a “house slipper” quality shoe ... this is it. Throw in a pair of insoles and they work great. Without the insoles, I would have had to return them.
214	I really dont like these. They fit strange and are not comfortable. I have several pairs of sneaker type shoes for work and these are at the very bottom of my rotation to wear. Wish i had just gone to kohls or something to try before i bought them. They are narrow and too big. This is the size i normally buy in shoes but they are too big length wise and too small width wise for my feet.
215	I bought these shoes for casual, comfy days.  Do I plan on running in these?  No.  In all fairness, I probably wouldn’t run in any shoes (unless I was being chased by a predator or running for the last bar of chocolate on earth).  These shoes were instantly comfortable. I wear a 9-9.5.  The ball part of my foot is med to wide; the heel of my foot is narrow. These work great.  I ordered 9.5 and these are true to size. They have a slight stretch in toe box to accommodate width. I can tied the securely so the heel fits. I love the cushy memory foam. I plan on wearing these at Disney, they are that comfortable.  They look pretty good. If I survive walking 5-10 miles at Disney, I will come back and update my post Disney experience. If I don’t survive, it probably was no fault of these shoes. I’d say one too many ice creams or getting into deadly fight triggered by one too many renditions of “It’s a Small World.”
216	"Our daughter is a varsity basketball player.  Most players finish practice and go to their ""slides"".  She wanted something that was easy to slip into but still secure as she has to drive about 30 miles to the practice facility.She loves them and wears them all the time.  Around the house, running errands, pre & post practice.  She says that they are super comfortable.  Highly Recommend."
217	I am highly impressed with these tennis shoes. Very comfortable. I have worn them for 16 hours straight with no problem! This is huge for me because my arches usually start to hurt. No problems at all. Fits true to size. Light-weight, and love the style.
218	These shoes DO feel like a cloud. They are so comfortable. I've never owned any adidas but I'm so glad my friends told me to buy these. They feel like sneaker slippers due to not having a shoe tongue...they feel great to run in. I would only suggest to size down though! Got a 9.5 and could have easily done a 9.
219	These are comfortable and I love that they are pull on. I love the simple and classic design. They definitely run big- Amazon said “fits as expected” and recommended a size 10. I got a 9.5 based on other people’s reviews and actually could have gone with a 9. So they are comfortable for walking but I would not want to run in them! I would buy again but definitely recommend going down a size or two.
220	Love these shoes!  I am a teacher and I am on my feet all day.  I love these shoes and highly recommend them.
221	These are cute but were too “clunky” for my 3 1/2 year old. They didn’t adjust small enough to fit her and the base of the sandal didn’t bend so she was unable to walk in them. We returned them, which the seller was great about. I would not recommend for littler kids, but perhaps ages 6 and up.
222	These are nice, casual summer sandals -- great for beach, pool, etc.  Daughter loves them!  Sizing seems OK in the kids' sizes.  The main drawbacks we see so far are:1. the rainbow-colored straps show dirt very easily, and2. while the foam footbed is soft & comfy, it will wear down fast
223	I wanted to love these shoes for my daughter BUT they were too small. We were sent a infant size and that’s not what I purchased. When receiving these shoes off the bat I realized these were something for looks rather than looks and being comfortable for my toddler to either A dress up in and B be able to walk for hours in them without cutting in to her feet. Sadly these weren’t what I thought they were!
224	These are the best shoes for kids! So comfortable and they last for a long time!
225	These have been the perfect summer shoes for my 7 year old daughter. She can run and play in them and they hold up great. I bought a second pair because we love them so much. And super stylish, surfer-like look too.
226	Cute and comfy sandals- fits perfectly on my daughter.
227	Bien
228	"Coming from a Moab Vent and Moab 2 Vent user, I was a bit skeptical that any other Merrell could provide the same comfort, but man do these things rock!.I have wide and flat feet so my shoe choices are somewhat limited. I originally chose the Moab Vents because of their out-of-the-box bang-on comfort and fit (you could buy those at the store and head directly to the trail head, they were that good). As I got more educated on what makes a good hiking shoe, I started to notice that my Moabs were a little too stiff and honestly didn't cinch down enough for my ankles (They always felt loose on me, going down half a size didn't help).After my Moab 2s finally cried Uncle, I looked for a bit more athletic hiker, not a Trail Runner, but something more streamlined with a bit less of a profile and footprint. I came across the Alverstones and after reading countless reviews, I saw the magic words, ""Large Toebox"" and ""Great for wide feet"". I got them delivered and threw them on for a quick 3-miler on varied terrain, and I gotta say these are my new hiking shoes. The fit is on a another level, so much more secure than the Moab 2s, and the footprint is just streamlined enough to where I don't feel boxy and like I'm wearing hiking boots (The Moab footprint was a bit too big for my taste). The quick-lacing system cinches down securely and the design of the tread allows for fast-paced hikes, which is what I enjoy.I do agree with others that the insole needs to be swapped out ASAP, especially for someone like me with my foot issues, not a problem as I just swapped out the aftermarket insoles I had in my Moab 2s.It's only been one hike, but I love them so far and don't see any issues coming up in the future."
229	The threads are showing on both toe covers in under 100 miles.  I've been walking everyday in these shoes for just under 4 weeks, which I average about 3 to 4 miles per day.  I probably have about 80 - 90 miles of mostly neighborhood walking with very little trail exposure.I'm filing a defect return with Merrell and will have to see how this goes.As for the fit, I initially struggled with trying to like these, as these are slightly wider than my prior Merrells.  I'm an 11W, and I really have to pull the laces tight to get the right fit, but I've been satisfied with comfort after the first day.The first 1 mile I had these on I was very doubtful.  One foot felt off centered, the other ankle lace was digging into my skin.  However, after taking the shoes completely off and checking my socks the soles and lacing up again, I've been happy every since.  So, don't be completely discouraged by first impressions, it may just take a little adjusting.
230	First I want to say that I am a woman and I buy men's shoes to get the width I need.  I have a neuroma in one foot and a fibroma in the other, along with high arches.  I need very wide shoes and lots of cushioning.  I purchased 4 pairs of Merrell hiking shoes at the same time, and this pair is the only one that was comfortable for me, so the others were returned.  I tried Moab 2 Vent in 2 widths, and Moab Edge 2.  I wear a size 8 to 8.5 in women's shoes, mostly wearing wide shoes like Altra and Crocs.  In a men's shoe I go down 1 to 1.5 sizes.  In this shoe a men's 7 wide was perfect.  No, you won't get the Vibram sole, but comfort was more important to me than the sole material.
231	Total disappointment; you certainly don't get what you pay for ($80.00) with these.  Merrell is supposed to be a good name with a good reputation for quality shoes, but unfortunately it hasn't been my experience with the last to pairs of hiking shoes I've purchased of theirs.I had these barely 4 months and both heels already had holes worn through the sole.  See attached pics.  Merrell minimizing material costs by reducing the thickness of the sole is just unacceptable for an $80.00 shoe.I certainly won't be purchasing Merrell any longer....Columbia are on my radar now.
232	Delivery was on time and no damages. As with all the other Merrell footwear I have purchased, these shoes are of the quality I expect from them. This is first time I have ordered Merrell products on Amazon, so not sure if that is the reason for my issue. I order 10.5 US from Merrell for all my hiking and general purpose shoes, but these seem about half an inch shorter in length than all my other 10.5 Merrell shoes. And I found out that Merrell lowered their price of this shoe to $80 - so I did not save any money by buying from Amazon! Lesson learned! I will NOT be purchasing footwear from Amazon in the future. I paid the same on Amazon as Merrell's website, and the fit is not the same as I expect. Tried to save a few dollars and screwed myself.
233	"I have had a pair of Merrell Moab Hiking Shoes that I use almost daily for my walking regiment and I have also used them twice walking sections of the Appalacian Trial and they have worn like iron. The only place they have shown much wear is the back of the shoe at the heel. I have had my Merrell Moab hiking shoes for over four years and they don't look too bad for ""old hiking shoes"" but because I have used them more lately for mowing the yard and working in my garden they just aren't ""pristine"" looking enough for wearing to outdoor picnics, parties, and eating out with my wife. I saw the Merrell Alverstone Hiking Shoes and liked the way they looked and the good price for them so I figured is they were anyway as good as the Merrell Moab Hiking Shoes I would be happy with them. So far I really like my new Merrell Alverstone Hiking Shoes. The fit was good right out of the box and I have had no problems doing by 1.5 to 2 mile daily walks with them. It's like they were already ""broken-in"" and I don't get any blisters or sore areas on my feet or heels from using them new right out of the box."
234	Updating my review (below) after I've been wearing these shoes for about two weeks.In addition to being smaller than the actual size and too narrow, they do not have much cushioning, which causes some heel pain after a long walk. I would return them but my guess it is too late.Previous review:These are indeed fine-looking shoes, comfortable and cushy. Hopefully, they will serve me well.On the downside, they are not exactly true to size: size 11 actually feels like 10.5. Also, they are moderately uneven: left shoe looks somewhat narrower and slightly curved toward the inside.
235	From my personal experience these don't even come close to moabs. Tried them hoping to get a good pair of Merrills for less then what I was used to spending.  I regret the decision. While they fit well enough, and have plenty of space. They don't provide the same support. 2 months in and my feet hurt walking in them for extended periods of time. It took my last pair of moabs well over a year to get to this point.  Unfortunately I'll end up buying a new pair of shoes much sooner then expected because I tried to save a few bucks.
236	I ordered these in a wide since I've been having issues with other shoe manufacturers being too small and tight but I could have gotten by with the standard width. I will continue to by Merrell shoes since they last forever and their shoe size fits as expected.
237	Love the shoe. Fit true to size. I will say though for anyone with a high instep, it might be a little difficult to get in.
238	The shies are very nice and comfertable as well its great for the spring tume and summer of course id recommend you buy them i bought every color
239	I'm already 6ft but I was curious how this works.  I figure women can automatically grow 3 inches taller with high heels, why can't guys try it?Well it did work with the height jump.  It's amazing feeling walking in a public place and all of the sudden looking down more on people's heads.  The only downside it they begin to hurt your feet after an hour or so.  It's not horrible and maybe that's what women deal w/ via high heels.  But if there was a way around this it would be nice.
240	Purchased these shoes for my Fiance to wear at our wedding in hopes it would give a little more height in our pictures.  We love them.  They look better in person!  My Fiance said they fit very comfy.  I guess the true test will be on our wedding day but so far everything looks great!!
241	Walking in them feels absolutely terrible. Like walking in loose heels or something. Perhaps feels better if they fit.
242	Too tight.
243	Great shoe, high quality. The extra height adds confidence.
244	I was shocked of the quality, perfection in every way, they are very comfortable, a little loud when walking on hard Floors but other than that they are amazing.
245	Nice elevation and style but toe area is tight and it hurts after a while
246	Me agrado el estilo, la elegancia y el Material de confección
247	It's a little to moderately tight across the toe area!
248	This pair of shoes is amazing.  My first good pair of running shoes since i started running last year.  This size fits me perfectly and I have an average width foot for a lady. I also have a high arch and these support me well. No foot pain on my walk/ run with these shoes.  I haven't tested out the water resistance on them yet because they look too good to get dirty.  Would definitely recommend this shoe.
249	When I ordered this sneakers I checked the sizes. My size is 6 and in the size chart it says size 4 UK is size 6 so I clicked that. When it arrived I saw it's size 7. I had this delivered in my friend's place in USA because I lived in the Philippines. My friend brought it today. I love everything the style, color except that it's not my size. My colleagues suggested to just wear 2 socks because it's really nioce on me and it fits my personality! Is it possible to have it changed? Please let me know....
250	These shoes work better the faster I go. Mercury's wings on my feet. Best way to describe the feeling is with each step, it's like a little hand tapping up from the ground into my foot. Sounds crazy but the technology is there.
251	Light weight, Hyperion tempo felt great even after a 10 mile race. I left them on afterwards and did not feel any discomfort. This shoe is made for competitive running and would not recommend training in them, but you can.
252	Light, soft but responsive cushion, comfortable, stretchy uppers, laces that flex.  These are a dream.In the words of Drake, “You the best I’ve ever had.”
253	Gift for son-in-law and he says the fit is great
254	You feel very quick in these shoes. Not for the beginner if training for distance running. Overall very well made. Will definitely recommend.
255	I like these shoes as a health care worker who is on my feet for 60 hours a week,  it's all about comfort.  Stepping into these is like stepping into a pillow.  They are remarkably soft and easy on my feet.
256	Puma, like Fila (the designer I wear) run tight across the foot and toe area, always for me. This shoe however runs tight across the top of the shoe. It’s how the shoe is sewn under the stretch band. I don’t like the sock shoe or boot shoe or whatever that shoe is called that doesn’t have laces and you have to wrestle with your foot to try and put them in. But these shoes I made an exception because of the style, I love it. Very uncomfortable, at first but now after several wears and washes, the shoes seem to be more tolerable. I get a lot of compliments on these shoes. I’m a 10 but I’m glad I got the 10.5, I know it made a difference in the fit...great. Too bad the bottom of the shoe wasn’t speckled in gold like the first Puma Prowl but it’s a comfortable nice shoe just the same ;)
257	"I have a white pair of Puma slip on sneakers and I love them but I wore them camping stupidly and they got ruined. So I've been on the hunt for a new pair and I came across these. I liked that the style was similar to what I already have and I liked that the sliver straps were sparkly. Totally up my alley. They look exactly as shown. They shipped pretty much right away. It didn't take long to receive them. When I got them I tried them on and the ""fit"" but unfortunately even though I ordered these in my size the material that they are made with probably wasn't the greatest choice because I can see the outline of my foot with the shoe on. I can see my toes very easily. So I can imagine if I were to wear them out and about people are going to be able to see the shape of my foot and my toes move while walking. It looks very odd. They are comfortable, the material is comfortable but not a good choice. Probably for anyone. Very lightweight too. I will be returning them and continue to look for another pair."
258	I really like them. They get a little uncomfortable after a while,but I guess the elastic will need time to stretch.
259	I read reviews to help in purchase decisions. So I hope this review helps you. In a shoe store using gauge I have a men's 10-1/2 D (regular width foot) actual size.  I buy size 11- Wide in everything I buy,Skechers,work boots etc.I like to ensure room for expansion and insert foot beds if needed. I bought sof sole gel insoles here on Amazon also.These arrived today, I ordered 11 X-W  They showed on order as 11 4E {?} Length is good,width is slightly snug with or without replacement insoles. If you truly have a wide foot,good luck. Otherwise the insoles are tacky stuck down but are removable,inserts make a big difference. Quality is good,bright white,look nice and yes I would recommend
260	These are fire I love them! I was scared when ordering these because they’re so cheap - less than $30 I thought they wouldn’t be authentic or made out of plastic. These are authentic, the box was in good condition all labels were on. They feel great when I put them on and I don’t see any signs of them being fake. Even have memory foam type material at the bottom feels good. I have been looking for some nice casual white leather shoes and these slap! I get mad compliments. I’m buying all these colors and will post the results. I would say that they are slightlyyyy narrow just a little. So if you have fat feet that may effect you. I didn’t let that effect the rating cause I don’t have that problem. Ima do some walking in them if they hurt my feet or somethin I’ll let y’all know.
261	Well made
262	The shoe has held up relatively well. The shoes are lightweight and material is pretty tough. I give three out of five stars because of the toe - better reinforcement of the toes considering little boys play hard (soccer during recess) and the toes of shoes need to hold up more than two weeks to soccer ball kicks.
263	My daughter loves the color light pink with the grey fits well looks great.
264	Super cute but too narrow.
265	my son loves it
266	Perfect
267	Great
268	These shoes are great, I had been looking for a pair of shoes that fit my feet and were comfortable for months, I had been everywhere I could think of to try and find a pair, even went to store to try shoes on all with no luck. Then I found these shoes, they fit great, it will be the first pair of shoes in years that don't break open on the sides for me and on top of that I was able to wear them right out of the box day 1 and they were comfortable. I'm on my feet a good amount of the day and wear these shoes for 12-14 hours a day and at the end of the day my feet don't hurt and I have noticed less back and leg pain since wearing these shoes. I liked them so much I turned around and purchased a 2nd pair in a different color and those are just as amazing. I would highly recommend these shoes.
269	I have owned many different pairs of the ASICS Gel-Nimbus Shoes over the years and have never been disappointed with the feel, performance and look of these shoes! Can't beat the price that I purchased this new ASICS Men's Gel-Nimbus 21 Running Shoes at! Very Happy!
270	Got here fast. Nice and comfortable shoe, I wear a 9.5 and they fit perfectly. Thanks!
271	Good running sneaker
272	They are soooo comfortable and stable! Forget about Nike! I strongly recommend ASICS. I’m very satisfied with the purchase.
273	Was delivered fast.
274	Super cool
275	Christmas gift for my son the runner
276	This was a gift for someone.
277	I've had a lot of Romas over time. They are great. But be sure to get a half a size larger than usual.
278	I love the color and how it fits on my 3 year old son. Would be purchasing another puma Roma. I delivery was faster than I expected. Love loving this shoes 😉
279	Loving these shoes just as image
280	My son loves this sneakers
281	It is good to know that if there were to be a problem that I could easily return.  With that being said all went well and they fit exactly as expected.  They were suppose to be for school but we had to try them out.  Perfect
282	My son loves this sneakers , he is wearing it all day long
283	It was a great fit
284	Fast delivery from USA. Quality product.
285	Just the summer cricket shoe for which I have been searching. The fit is accurate, the shoe is the most comfortable in my wardrobe. I do not hesitate to recommend this product. The shoes appear well made; thye are of a quality that one expects.
286	I like it...
287	Nice looking, comfortable, and very light.
288	They are used for playing the pedals on the organ!
289	The best tap shoes. I'm a french tap teacher and thanks to amazon.com, I purchased professional tap shoes, that I used to buy an amazing price (250 $), for a very small price. The delivery was very fast and the product perfect. As I have a very good cobbler for the build up, I have now professional tap shoes for half price. Thank you amazon.com, I will be a returned customer.P.S. for capezio tap shoes, you have to know your perfect size before ordering.
291	I think there is a big problem with the way this shoe is sized. I am not convinced that this shoe can be fit to a woman's foot.I ordered and tried 3 different sized pairs. The last one that I decided to keep and wear caused me very large and painful heel blisters after 20 minutes of dancing. Of course now that they are used I cannot return. $300. loss.I think you would do better with a cheaper shoe. My Blochs never caused these problems.
292	The shoes that were in the box were the wrong size a 13 1/2 not 12 as stated in the ad.
293	This shoe looks good but doesn't feel good! They made a sore 😩 on my heel! I'm sticking with adidas!
294	It is comfortable and nice, a good buy
295	The back of the shoe is high and rubs blisters....
296	Be careful-- there is no realistic return policy, I like in FL and they want $100 to return
297	The shoes I received are not the same shoes pictured. The shoes pictured had a velcro strap closure. The shoes I received appear to have the same lower body, however they have  lace closures. Disappointing!
298	Sooouu...4 month old shoes. Cute, bright, fit as expected. I've owned new balance before and have always been happy with the brand. These did not hold up. My daughter barely wore them because she has many shoes. I just now realized how worn they look. In these 4 months these shoes have never been washed or cleaned (demonstrating they truly are still new) and you can see the soles are barely worn but very torn and worn on the fabric side. Pictures attached for you to use your own judgement.
299	"These are fantastic shoes for my seven year old.  He loves them.  We ordered the white ones, which turned out having pink-lavenderish-""N""s on them.  I pulled out a black Sharpie and changed that before my son saw.  Lol.  These plastic toggles on the laces have not held up.  One is completely gone already, with another hanging by a thread.  Not sure why.  Great grip.  Easy to wipe clean."
300	I purchased these for my daughter who wears a 2.5. They arrived today and she had the hardest time putting them on. When I tried I did as well but succeeded. She said they were way too tight and hurt her foot. As far as appearance, they are nice looking but you may need to order half a size up or even wide for your kiddo (we never had to buy wide for her shoes).
301	Fit as expected, however these have shown wear rather quickly. They do not tighten around my daughter’s ankles well so they rub together throughout the day as they are sticking out a bit. She says then are comfortable shoes- they just didn’t stay looking nice as long as I expected. She started wearing these late August- so this is less than 4 months of wear.
302	My son has wide feet and normally has a least half an inch of toe room in a size 11. However, these shoes fit just right. I bought a wide and the shoe was snug on his foot as well with thin socks. I am returning for a larger size since I love the quality. Pictures do not do it justice! Buy the shoe but go for a larger size and XW if your child has a wide foot.
303	My son is kind of particular about how his shoes look. But I picked these out without him and he loved them. The basic color is great since he wears them every day. He says they're comfortable. I bought them a little big for him to grow into, but they still work well for him. So far the quality is good. We'll see in a few more months, but I have high hopes.
304	I got these for my 5 & 1/2 year old, so take that into consideration when he says they are the best shoes he’s ever worn 😄I like the fact that I could get a pair of classic trainers for him in extra wide. 3rd paid of NBs for him and will continue to do so.
305	We bought these for my elementary son to run cross country.  They are well made, but do not offer as much support as some of the other options out there.  They will serve our purposes for this season, but I will likely choose something with more support next time.
306	I bought this for my boy, and they came to large. On top of that its described as girls shoes , and I don’t  Find them very girly Decent looking UNISEX shoes that I hope my son will wear in near future
307	fit my duck shaped feeta bit tight across the toes but they will break in
308	The liner to the boot runs VERY SMALL. My toddler is a size 5, I ordered a 6, and the boot is big but the liner is tiny and very narrow. The width of the liner is seriously that of a newborn shoe. It’s that narrow and small. Her foot WILL NOT fit into it. Forget trying to put a foot with socks on it into the boot. I’m seriously debating on returning these if the liner is unusable and the boots won’t keep her feet warm without it. Without the liner it’s essentially a fancy rainboot, there is zero integrated padding/warmth into the boot.
309	My son is 22 months and the liner was WAY too narrow for his foot!!  Even taking the liner out and trying to get just that on him before trying the boot on, I wasn’t able to get his toes past the middle of the liner.  It was quite literally HALF the width of his wide, little baby foot!  They were also very heavy and clunky, so if we could have gotten them on, I imagine they would have been difficult for him to walk in.
310	While I'm sure these are warm & I love Columbia, these boots are much too clumpy for a toddler. My one year old loves to walk & run, but in these boots she can hardly lift her feet, so insists on being carried, even when just testing them in the house. Might be fine for an older child, but I would go with Land's End in that case, anyway.
311	I really wanted these boots to work! So much so that I ignored the other reviews and tried them anyway. The inside liner is not just small, but bunches up making it impossible to get a foot into them. In addition to that the shaft is so stiff it makes it challenging to get it past the ankle. I love everything Columbia, and they’re a trusted brand, but I’m so super bummed by these!
312	Probably great but too hard to get on their feet. After about the third time I just didnt want to do it again so they just sat there. I got the kamiks and they slip right on perfect fit. These fit well but you almost have to break your kids leg to get them in them.
313	The liner in this boot is just cheap foam. Does not even seem like it will keep a child’s feet warm. My son is a toddler size 5, that’s what was purchased. I cannot even get his foot down into the boot because they are so tight even at the ankle.
314	My son loves these! They are very good quality. I never have a problem with any Columbia product that I purchase.
315	These boots are great. They fit as expected and they are sturdy. They have held up to little boy ruff and tuff play. No matter how long they have been out or how wet the snow has been their feet come out dry. There has even been some complaints of hot feet. Which is a great thing in my book.
316	Great quality. Sturdy boots. My son can DESTROY any pair of boots or shoes in a week... he has many many times! But these have held up well to the abuse they take on a daily basis! Never hear conplaints about cold piggies!
317	This is a well built, lightweight waterproof shoe. I'm a size 13, and it feels just a tad bit small. These shoes took a long while to break in, to the point where I almost gave up on them, which would have been a shame considering the price. About a month in, wearing them once a day for a walk, I'm at the point where I feel they are a good, quality walking shoe now that they're broken in. So far they've kept water out during light rain and small puddles.
318	Great
319	First off, I had no problems with the seller or shipping. The problem with these shoes was that the toes have an angular design that caused my toes to get uncomfortably squeezed, and they seem to run small too. The angle didn't look too sharp in the picture but it definitely feels too sharp. This was my first time trying women's puma shoes do I didn’t really know what to expect and had to return these.
320	My 11 year old granddaughter loves these sneakers. They are stylish and Puma makes great athletic shoes. I bought two pairs.
321	Just as comfy as I was hoping they’d be and they look great! I’ve gotten compliments from guys and girls.
322	I like the color schemes , cushions in soles
323	They fit just right and look really nice
324	Shoes was dirty and it wasn’t what I was expected. Also it looks as though it was wore before and partially cleaned up with white shoe polish added. I am very disappointed!
325	I bought these for a family member who has real difficulty getting shoes to fit comfortably because of her disability. They're my favourite shoes and now they're also her favourite shoes they fit great she's able to walk better than usual.  I couldn't ask for a better pair of shoes for her.
326	I love these shoes.  I can wear them all day and my feet don’t hurt at the end of the day! I have five pair now.  And I can throw them in the washing machine when they get dirty.
327	I bought this shoe for my mother who is in assisted living. These shoes are the most comfortable Sketchers I have ever had...so, I bought myself some too! LOL
328	Got these for my mom and she loves them, wears them everyday.
329	Red shoes for a cause.  Great price, comfortable walking support, but narrow.  I wish they came in wide sizes.
330	These shoes are super-comfortable and I'm so happy with the color! Skechers never disappoints me.
331	Received my Skechers and they fit great
332	This is a beautiful shoe but the toe box is narrow.  I wear a regular in most shoes but Clark’s seem to run narrow for me.  Well worth the money if you know how they fit.
333	Great look and comfortable at the same time! Also light to walk for awhile.
334	Been wearing this brand exclusively for 8+ years and I appreciate the comfort these shoes provide. The are sleek enough for formal meetings and casual enough for classroom teaching. I always look for the best price as Clark’s are expensive, which I why I got this pair - I usually get them at Clark’s. I wear these 5 days a week 10 hours a day and they last almost all year with only the sole wearing out. Note: I do maintain them weekly by cleaning and polishing which probably helps the lasting look and feel of the uppers.
335	Not clarcks , it came in unsturctured brand boxEven clarcks not graved on shoes
336	Used wardrobe to try on a few pairs of slip ons as I wear them for work. These are comfortable and fit just right. It was up between these or the hush puppies. Ultimately went with these to try and was not diappointed.
337	Excellent quality. Beautiful shoe.
338	Cute but the cut of these did not work for me, returned.  The insole was cushiony but the shape of the boot made it uncomfortable to walk in.  Also, the top of the boot has a large opening which is good for accommodating different sizes but it slides around unless you cinch it all the way with the laces which I think will crease the material over time and also just felt kind of weird.  I would like to see this concept redesigned since it is a cute style but just fits really strangely (sizing up or down wouldn't have helped) and did not feel very practical.
339	I was so DISAPPOINTED that these walking shoes would NOT allow me to slide my foot inside ! I'm 66 yrs old and walk my 82 lb dog twice a day.  These shoes looked like the perfect footwear for light snowfall days.  HAH. The opening at the top is too narrow and rigid.  There are no gussets that allow the opening to widen and accomodate your heel and ankle.  Very POOR design !  Because of that I cannot comment on the fit or comfort.  I had high hopes for these.  The tread on the bottom of the shoe and the ankle support would have made this a very stable shoe/boot.
340	I really like these boots but I just wish they were a little bit more comfortable. I had to return my regular size and get a half size bigger because they definitely run small. I did keep the 7 1/2 because they are easy to wear and get around in in the city, but I find that my heel to slip out just a little bit even with my orthotics inside. I don’t think I would wear them every day but the days that I do with them they are pretty comfortable
341	Looked nice-had to return too small
342	Could not get my foot all the way in the shoe. No side zipper or opening at the shoe laces to open up the shoe
343	I was unable to put my foot in the shoe. Returned immediately!!
344	Warm. Look good. However the soles make my ankles legs and knees bend in. I won’t be wearing them because of knee arthritis. Love new balance sneakers and was hoping these would be equally good.
345	Nice boots.
346	I do workout videos several times a week.  I like to make sure that my shoes can stand up to all the moves.  These shoes fit perfectly and are great to workout in.  I love the longer tongue on the shoes-I know that sounds funny, but they protect the ankle area more than most shoes do.
347	Comfy love it
348	Very Good Product!
349	Value for money
350	Why are athletic shoe companies putting these weird things under the soul? Is it supposed to be a gel pad or what? Instead of making the shoe more comfortable, it makes the shoe less comfortable. Please, just give us a nice smooth insole. . Don’t put these gel pads in there because they don’t work and we can feel them so it defeats the purpose.  If it’s not a gel pad I don’t know what it is. But it’s a horizontal lump going from left to right under the ball of the foot area. Also I don’t like the toe area, too pointy, prefer more rounded.
351	I was worried b/c multiple reviews said these run large and order down a size but I wear a 5 which is the smallest size. They fit fine though and feel nice
352	These are exactly as described. Reebok is the best!! I ordered an 8.5 and they fit perfectly
353	"This shoe is a knock off!!! The printed logo ""Reebok"" is supposed to be in the white part of the back area above ankle as seen in picture #1 above. Notice pic #2 doesn't have it. For $65 it's a rip-off"
354	I wasn't sure if I would like these shoes because I couldn't find many written reviews. I've searched the internet for a nice comfy white sneaker to go with every outfit. I didn't want to spend a ton, definitely not over $100. I found these and prayed they would fit right, and not hurt my feet, and also look good. They are super cute, and fit very well. I've always been in between a 9 and 9 1/2, I never really know what size to get. I went for a 9 and they fit wonderfully. They are very comfortable , and I'm excited to wear them with every outfit and not ruin my feet!
355	These shoes are very light weight, softly cushioned and very comfortable for all day wear! I got a half size bigger just because but I think it’s okay to order true to size! Got a pair for my friend also, bought true to size and they fit her great! Easy to clean also, I just use a wet wipe after I get home for any marks or smudges.
356	Wanted to buy this product for both casual and slightly smart casual wear, but the material isn't really good for smart casual wear, so it sort of defeated my purpose for buying it. The Men's Street Encounter series are much better, and the material used also more formal and suitable for smart casual wear. Shoes are overall quite light and easy to wear, but it simply didn't fit my purposes. Would recommend for casual wear though!
357	Too too small. I have wide feet, but I even had my daughter and granddaughter try them who wear a size 8, they both said they fit like a 6.
358	Light and comfortable, love them.
359	These are a little fancier than I would send my kid to school in.They are more like a fancy occasion, Sunday church, holiday, or just an “I can’t find my sneakers” day (it happens).I was anxious about the “slip on” as sometimes this style is actually harder to get on kid’s limp feet as they don’t tend to push their foot in to help you out at all when trying to get the shoes on. I was surprised that my kid could actually get these on all by himself and without any socks to ease the way to boot. I’m pleased that the elastic panels built in actually stretch enough so the kids can get their foot in.The quality of these is really good. They look and feel like a high quality men’s shoe, just in a mini me, kid’s size. This is a great shoe to match Dad in.My kid was so excited about his new shoes he ran errands around town in them the day he got them.Can’t wait for him to wear these to picture day, etc.Overall I’d recommend them.
360	Pros:1. They work well for almost any occasion.2. Comfortable, my son has no complaints and gives them a big thumbs up3. They look very nice in person, very happy with the style.Cons:1. They are showing very slight signs of wear after a month but to be fair my child is very active.2. The materials used for these shoes aren’t bad but also not high grade either.Overall these are a great pair of shoes. There is a little room for improvement but overall I’m happy with them and i would definitely get them again.
361	I love that these have the utility of a sneaker but can slip on easily without my child needing to tie the shoes or mess with velcro straps!  Very well made, durable child shoe.  My child feels comfortable in them and has never complained about wearing them (he would be barefoot all the time if that were an option). They dry faster than most of his other shoes---which is helpful because he refuses to put on a wet shoe-and I don't blame him!.  Worth the extra expense for its functionality and ease of putting on.
362	My 6 year old likes these.  They're comfortable and easy to slip on, they have good stretch to fit over his foot. They're lightweight, too.They appear to be a well-made and attractive shoe.  No loose threads or wonky stitching.  They're cute for summer with a pair of shorts, but they would dress up nicely with a pair of khakis.I'm very happy with these, I would definitely recommend.
363	I like these shoes a lot. I got them for my son he needs a little more growing to do though i like to get them big so he can used them as much as possible. They are very soft on the inside, lots of cushion for the back of the heal. I can tell they are well made with hight quality materials and are flexible, slip resistance for outdoor activities all day long.
364	Genuine leather is always a plus for any kind of shoes, they're so much more durable. These are of a high enough quality that we will easily be able to pass them on to our youngest when our older son is done with them. Easy to slip on and off, and the elastic at the shoe's opening helps with wider feet. Looks great with jeans and little boy khaki pants.
365	I like the look of these shoes, and they seem to be high quality. I think they're a great casual look -  nicer than sneakers without being too formal or grown-up. My son says they're one of the most comfortable pairs he's ever owned. Both of us enjoy the ease of them being slip-on.
366	My 7-year-old loves these shoes. They are casual enough for everyday wear, but also nice enough when he needs to dress up a bit. They fit and feel like sneakers, but look like loafers. Great shoes for an active little guy.
367	Everyone has Birkenstocks and I wanted something a little different, and I love Sorel shoes, so I gave these a try.  They are super comfortable and cute, though I have wide feet and this style is not flattering to my specific feet.  But I don't care.  We are living through a pandemic and I want comfort.  And I can see beyond the ugliness of my feet to appreciate the beauty of these shoes.  Highly recommend!  Fit true to size.
368	Didn’t like them as much at first. Gave me bad blisters, kind of slid off, almost returned them. But now I wear them all of the time! Great support.
369	Size up 1/2 size. 9 fits just like 8 1/2. Very cute and comfy. Leather will stretch a bit. Very happy with this Sorel purchase!
370	Comfortable, TTS, good quality.
371	Attractive, good sale price and comfy
372	The sandal did not grip my foot. I had a difficult time walking in them. Had to return.
373	These may fit if I hope on to them in two or three years. I was really shocked at the size.  They were like 5 inches to long.  I had ordered one size up so went to different company ordered the size and is 12 and perfect fit. Little roomy and perfect. Will be sending them back if I don't miss window. I was just shocked how huge.  I should have read the comments. My little one cried and cried.  They folded when she tried to walk in them.  It was like watching her walk in my shoes
374	I bought these for our grandaughter she wears them all the time.  The boots are super cute and of high quality. They are  not a  cheap build like most I have seen at our local target stores. Well worth the money, especially if you have another younger  child who can wear  them after their sibling is done with them.
375	Beautiful boots but be aware they are very heavy.  I bought them for my two year old granddaughter.  She can barely lift them.  A larger size for older kids would probably be ok... like a 5 year old might be able to handle them in their size.  But not ideal for toddlers.
376	My 2 yr old granddaughter absolutely loves these boots. These are the only shoes she wants to wear. She can put them on and take them off by herself. They are well made. Easy to keep clean. You just wipe them off.
377	My toddler is really a 5- but I wanted her to be able to put these on and off herself- so I expected them to be big and they were! She loves them and has been wearing them around the house. It’s raining today so it should be interesting to see how she likes them outside!
378	My daughter loves these.  They are a bit larger than expected which is fine. Gives her room to grow. We live in Phoenix so it doesn't rain often, but she's thrilled to run and jump in muddy puddles and not ruin her good shoes.
379	My daughter loves these!! These are perfect for little guys to pull on with the handles. We bought a coat and umbrella to match as well! Cant wait to jump in puddles!
380	They run a little big but they are really cute my niece wears a size ten in toddler and these boots in size ten slipped right on and off her foot making it kinda hard for her to walk because of the looseness
381	These boots were a Christmas gift for my 2  year old granddaughter . She wears a size 8 and these were roomy, however, she walks fine in them. VERY cute boots and she loves them! Theses boots have been worn ALOT since Christmas and still look super cute after being cleaned.
382	My granddaughter loved these rain boots! She’s three and loves Mickey and Minnie Mouse. Perfect gift.
383	These shoes were perfect!  I got mine as a Christmas present and am so happy with them. They do run slightly larger than your actual size, so size down a half size. These are authentic because I keep seeing people asking. The ones with the serial numbers on them, that's the style of those ones. For some reason Adidas decided to leave those like that. You can look at the actual Adidas website and you can cross reference those specific colors/styles and you will see that they have serial numbers on them from the actual website as well.  These shoes are some of the most comfortable shoes I've ever worn, they are the best!
384	I forgot to write a review on this item, however I got these a couple months ago for my sister and she loved them. Not only did she say they were comfortable but they are also very stylish. They fit her nice and she loved them
385	i got 10.5 like i always do with adidas shoes but had to return for the 10 and its still semi too large.  Not the most comfortable but they do look nice.  Probably won't work out in these as i expected to be able to due to that.
386	I know these shoes run large buy a .5 size down ! I get lots of compliments on these
387	These are beautiful! I have one other pair in this style so I know they run large. I recommend sizing down one size. I'm normally a size 8 in womens but these i ordered a 7 and they fit perfect. Lightweight and comfortable. Love the color!
388	absolutely love these. didn’t want to pay full price for these shoes and they are perfect
389	The shoes were a gift and they loved it! Perfect gift.
390	Cute and functional all in one !! Recommend !!
391	Run a little big. Go half a size down.
392	Country of origin:  These sandals are made in VietnamFinish:  These appear to be injection molded, so even though they might ultimately crack/tear, but they should be somewhat more reliable than the glued ones.Fit:  Very narrow width, extremely tight. My shoe size is 10.5, Medium width for my New Balance 990 series. Since these sandals do NOT come in half sizes, I ordered these New Balance sandals in Size 11, Medium width. Result?  Very NARROW WIDTH, and the fit is extremely tight and uncomfortable. Pretty disappointing. Not sure what size chart they used when manufacturing these, but it surely isn't the same chart for fitting the NB 990 series.Conclusion:  If you are going to order these, might want to keep the caveat about narrow width in consideration.
393	They're sandals - not much else to say. The fit and color are as advertised. Decent value for money if bought on sale, although I probably wouldn't pay full price for them.
394	These are great sandles . bout them for running out to the hot tub, they seem good and durable . should last for years
395	After 1 match, going all 3 min, it is loosing the color coating on the toe of the shoe. The black part is coming off and the red is showing through...just 1 Match!  This I am very disappointed about. Bought my son the solid black ones last season and they did great. That is what ultimately made me decide to purchase these this season for him. However, for $107.00 I expected to get a solid shoe that would take wear better than 1 match.
396	My daughter got almost two seasons of wear out of these shoes. We just bought another pair in a different color because the first pair is starting to wear out. We feel this is a very acceptable amount of use. She loves the way they feel. Her women's shoes size is 7.5-8 and she wears a 6.5 in the Mat Wizard 4.
397	Had to return these. The started falling apart after four days of practice. The tongue came completely off on one shoe and the toe stitching came apart on both shoes. We have had kids wrestling for 10 years and have never had a pair of wrestling shoes that did not make it through one season. These did not make it through 4 days, which was a shame. The shoes felt good, and provided good traction on the mat.
398	Initially I was submitting a better review, but i cannot honestly say they're as good as we'd like. My son wears these for training and competitions. He said they're pretty comfortable, but he's only had them for seven weeks, and they're looking ugly. They're peeling and starting to come apart. I really hoped because they were Adidas brand, they would be better quality. Now I feel embarrassed for him when he has to show up at a Tournament and the shoes look like he's had them for ages.
399	Not very wide and comfortable compared to size 12 asics with medium thickness wool socks.As One is cloth and the other is some newer molded stuff.I wear thinner wool socks and fit snug. Can wear all day, during gym and errands, comfortably.Really grippy.  Just wish I could wear my normal wool socks.
400	True to size. Very comfortable. I use the at the gym for cardio and working the heavy bag. Quality is solid. One downside is that they’re not very breathable as my feet sweat in these shoes a lot.
401	Fit exactly as expected.  My high school son loves them and was able to wear them right out of the box.  Highly recommend.
402	Sleek shoe. It's a perfect fit for my son. Very light shoe; when my son outgrows it, we'll buy another just like it.
403	This is a great starter spike. My son loves the feel how lightweight it is.
404	great shoes!
405	Great pair of track shoes. They held up for the season and then some. Would definitely buy again.
406	Lovem!!!
407	These things are great I have been using water shoes for years for cycling ,kayaking and the gym ,they are also nice to drive in ,if you can't decide on a colour do as I did and get the pair with all of them 😊 most arrive smelling like a chemical factory however these do not ! My feet love them and they fit wonderfully .
408	Very disappointed. They fit properly, however the toe part tore on the very first day of wearing them to an indoor waterpark. My big toe was sticking out after getting out of the wave pool. What a waste of money!! I can't wear these anymore.
409	They don't fit snug for use in the water. The material looks nice and well made and they are cute. Will look into getting a smaller pair.
410	Love these! Fit perfectly and have a great sole. They are good enough to wear around the pool deck to protect my feet from the heat, and inside the pool, my feet don’t get torn up from the bottom of the pool (its a public pool, so I feel it’s more sanitary too).I take water aerobics and they’re so comfortable, I forget I have them on. Love them!
411	Awesome little water shoes, wore them camping wear ae were in and out of water, swimming, kayaking,  tubing. Most water shoes give me blisters,  these didnt, and I wore them for 5 days. Threw them in wash when I got home,  air dried, good as new. They run alittle tight but loosen up as you wear them! Well worth the price!
412	Overall no complaints. Bought to go river rafting. Had no issues with them slipping off and didn’t feel the roughness of the rocks. We only did class 3 and below.The sizes are a little tricky I would buy a size down to make sure they don’t slip off.
413	These things are great!. With the price I thought maybe last 1 or 2 times on the river.Nope I crashed 3 times first trip. Kept my feet safe from rocks and when standing on rocks and mud my feet were secure and less muddy. I've used them every time I go kayaking. They are a must!!!!!
414	I bought a pair for myself and for my husband. They are great. Three slip-on hugs the foot very well, and there is enough sole that protected the foot from broken sea shells while walking on the beach.
415	They are the best I have 5 pair I even have my husband wearing them he also loves them they are so comfortably can be warn with anything they are great
416	Looked nice when they came, but after two or three times in the pool they are coming apart. I suppose these kinds of swim socks are good for light use; they didn't hold up to active swimming and playing in the pool. I was refunded.
417	My two-year-old grandson loves them doesn't want to take them off easy for him to put on and take off himself so that makes him feel awesome can I put a 3/4 warm because their summer sandals they're not warm sandals but we really really love them they're cute as can be
418	Very cute.
419	Loved the color, loved the look and style of the sneaker, but they tend to run narrow and short in toe-box.  So, order at least 1/2 size up for best fit
420	This is my third pair. Love them !
421	UPDATE: I unfortunately had to reduce my review by 2 stars. After just a few hikes, the soles are falling apart. It’s a shame because I really loved these shoes.These were sooooo comfortable right out of the box. I get good traction and they handle getting wet very well. They’re pretty cute too!I should also mention that I typically wear an 8, and although the front of my foot is a normal width, my heels are very narrow; these shoes fit me very well in a 7 ½.
422	These worked great for my recent trip to Zion National Park for hiking through the Narrows.  The shoe is comfortable and drains well.  I did size down a half size but otherwise fit well.  The shoes did take awhile to dry even though they drained well.  They were comfortable to wear, even without socks but did not offer much arch support.  If I were to wear them when not hiking through water I would need to add a shoe insert to provide arch support.  Overall worked great for what I needed them for and I will wear them again when hiking through rivers or tubing.
423	This is the perfect shoe for walking and moderate hiking--light enough to wear everyday and rugged enough for rocky and wet trails.  Just toss them in the wash when needed.  This summer I landscaped my hilly, and in places very muddy backyard in these shoes.  They held up and still look great.
424	LOVE the look and color of these shoes and, in general, love Minnetonka products. I ordered my normal size, 8 1/2, and couldn't even get my heel in the shoe. So I ordered a size 9. Though I could get my foot in the shoes, they were so narrow they hurt. This is the first product I've bought from Minnetonka that was so narrow. All their other shoes have run true to the width indicated. If you have narrower feet, these are for you! (My office mate loved them and now they're hers!)I'm sorry they didn't fit me as they are really good looking shoes.
425	They are soooo comfy and great in the water! I love a shoe that you can hike and go in and out of creeks and waterfalls with out constantly changing she’s!
426	This shoe is awfully heavy and seems to have no room inside.  I had to really  struggle to get my foot inside a shoe a half size larger than what I generally wear.  It was quite uncomfortable.  Since I purchased it at a much reduced price and it seems to be well constructed, I am sending the pair on to the thrift store.  It is my hope that the shoes may actually fit someone who really needs a new pair.  This is the first time I have been dissatisfied with Minnetonka shoes.
427	"I ordered a pair. Says ""men"" on listing so ordered smaller to fit woman size.  Shipped a women's shoe at that size. Too small.  I reordered 3 pairs with Women sizes because I was going on a trip and needed them.  Checked cart. Said ""Merrell womens J033884 HYDROTREKKER SYN SHANDAL, Brindle, 9 US"" plus 2 other sizes/color.  Great! Correct sizes I thought.  Order arrived  with Womens  5.5, 6, 6.5.  NOT AT ALL WHAT I ORDERED.Now I have 4 pair to return. None of which is what I ordered."
428	First time I have ever had a shoe in my size that has run too small. Great looking shoe though.
429	I love these so much I sent a pair to my daughter...They are comfortable and cute...LOVE THEM
430	The shoe is comfortable a d easy to get into. Love the color too?
431	These shoes fit length wise just fine. But the toe area was too constricting. I have pretty narrow feet myself but these just felt like there was not enough height as well as width in the toe.
432	Nice sneaker! Fits great and comfortable!
433	Great color, style and comfort! I would definitely purchase these again.
434	Most uncomfortable shoes I have ever worn. I wore them for less than two hours. The heal dug into two spots on my heals and caused huge blisters. The toe area also rubbed the skin off several toes. It was a week before I could wear closed shoes again.
435	I liked these shoes at first. I liked the simple look and the comfort. But, the first time I wore them in actually rain, my feet got wet! Really bummed because I’ve missed the return window now.
436	These are great shoes. My review reflects the fit as tighter than others of the same size but different brand. I would recommend going at least 1/2 size up
437	Runs small wide is very narrow
438	These are seriously one of the most comfortable shoes I've ever owned.  First pair of Skechers and I'm in love.  I have wide feet and my left foot is half a size bigger than my right, so I usually can't just buy shoes without trying them first.  I intended these to be personal shoes to use when I go out of the house with the family but don't want to wear running shoes.  But I've found myself bringing them to work because they look very professional and at the same time feel very comfortable.  I get about 12,000 steps a day when I'm at work so these have been amazing feet savers.  I even used them to teach a dance class and forgot that I wasn't wearing my dance shoes because they didn't stick to the wooden floors like basketball shoes yet have much more comfort than formal dance shoes.  I'm definitely getting another pair.
439	"I'm glad I took another reviewers advice and ordered a half size larger than what I normally wear.  My sneaker size is 9.5 but I ordered a 10 in this shoe and it fits just right.  The memory foam is perfect as I work in a retail environment and am on my feet many hours a day.  The casual loafer style also fits my work environment. I am very happy I made the decision to purchase this pair of shoes and will probably buy more in different colors. The price here can't be beat. I purchased another set of ""memory foam"" loafers at a local payless chain and for $10 more than what I paid for these Sketchers they are not even close in comfort. Highly recommend these."
440	These are exceptionally comfortable loafers. They are very light and they have the very comfortable memory foam insole. I have a relatively high instep, so loafers do not always work well for me. These are surprisingly comfortable. Oddly enough, they are more comfortable to walk around in than they are to wear while sitting (high instep thing ... I guess). The material seems to breath better, my feet to not get as hot as they would with other shoes. The quality of the materials and of the construction is top notch. I may even buy another pair in a different color.
441	Super comfortable. Easy on and off. I can walk miles at a time and feet fell fine. I bought these for a exact replacement of my very worn pair should they ever wear out. I later bought another pair because my old ones were very worn. This last pair is exactly the same and beyond great for walking and comfort. Easy to put on and off is a great feature also.
442	I’m searching for a cute yet quality shoe for a trip to Barcelona in fall.  This shoe was almost perfect.  Its really very pretty (I got the wine color).  It’s very comfortable, and the material has a lot of stretch and give— comfortable out of the box.  The only uncomfortable part was that my big toe rubbed on the top of the shoe.  Not the end— they were the right size— but the top, which bothered me while I walked.  If you’re thinking about these, definitely give them a try though.
443	I really want to love these but the support isn't there. I wish there was a Chaco support lightweight type of running shows. It still feels light. It's like putting you foot in paper. That's how light it is. I have flat feet so it does hurt to walk in these. Still very cute.
444	I've loved chacos sandals for several years. I was thrilled to find out they carried regular shoes when my work pair were coming to the end of their life. I work on my feet and my fitbit reports between 7,000 and 10,000 steps a day. These have been great. They have the arch support I've come to expect with chacos and are as lightweight as my off duty slide on sketchers. As long as they turn out to be as durable as my sandals these will be a phenomenal purchase.
445	The only thing I dislike is that the padding on the upper part of the back of the shoe is not enough.  They cause blisters on my heel at the top.  I hope that stops as they break in because the rest of the shoe is great.
446	I have very high arches and am constantly battling planter fasciitis.  Chacos tend to work well for my feet so i thought I would try these for running and walking.  I added my own insoles on top of the ones that came with the shoes and have been running for 4 weeks with no problems!
447	I bought these when I needed something to wear for hiking AND city walking that wasn’t ugly AF like most hiking shoes. Here I am two years later, my Chacos have strolled through nature trails and city streets in 30 states and 3 continents. The tread has finally worn down, so I’m getting a second pair. They’re great! Thank goodness for hiking shoes that come in civilized black, rather than fugly swirly browns.
448	I love these shoes. I have walked, lite hiking and worked in them. They run just a little small. I ordered my normal size. I have plantar fasciitis and these shoes have been great for that.
449	I was hesitant to buy tennis shoes from Chacos. I adore their sandals and the high arch support, but wondered if the same could be accomplished in their tennis shoes. I was wrong; these are awesome. I get on the treadmill first thing in the morning, and those of us with PF know, that's when the worst pain is. These make it so. much. better. Highly recommend.
450	"Was looking for a shoe for work,on feet and a lot of walking,that have a footbed like a pair of cheap flip flops bought last year that are similar to chacos. The flip flops are all I wear when not working, don't hurt my feet. So far,so good, just wish they came with a choice of width and my feet are different from each other. Like other reviews,on one heel it rubbed and the opposite foot it rubbed pinky toe with socks on, irritating! Just have to break-in. I go through ""work shoes""/inserts about 6 months.  On a side note, didn't appreciate the UPS man just throwing the package on porch! Just because no car doesn't mean no one home and watching."
451	I absolutely love these shoes!I’ve ordered 2 pairs so far. Some of my favorite things about this shoe is that there’s little to no need to “break in” the shoe, they fit my wide feet very comfortably, they are very sturdy, and they are very comfortable and I can walk for miles and not get blisters! I mainly wear them for work. I work in a kitchen as a waitress and these do an amazing job. They grip well on slick surfaces, I just wouldn’t run on the slick surfaces. My last pair lasted me just shy of a year, but I did wear them pretty much everyday walking anywhere from 4-6+ miles a day give or take. They are also great for most  hiking endeavors.I highly recommend these shoes if you’re looking for a light hiking shoe or a gripping work shoe.
452	Short break in time and great.
453	I'm on my feet all day. Did not feel fatigued at the end of the day. They were very comfortable.
454	This is a great product! I would purchase
455	Narrow shoe nowhere near US sizes..not real clarks..
456	Wear to work
457	Shoe is very comfortable. Came quick and packaged well
458	Nice brown color goes well with brown oe beige pants
459	I purchased these sneakers for my son and they were listed as mens. When I received the shoes they said women's on the box and looked like women's sneakers. Very disappointed.
460	Great shoes! I have a high arch and slightly wide foot, plus I suponate when I run. These fit perfectly and have the right support to keep my feet from rolling out. Plus half the price of my normal running shoes!! They also did well for lifting.
461	I bought these for my son because I was having a hard time finding a men's version in his size. The first time he wore them he set a PR in his 800. He has continued to improve and set PRs as a freshman runner in track. The shoes are comfortable enough for him to run his 800 and the 3200. They are very lightweight and yet durable because of the way the shoe is made and the material.
462	My daughter uses this for track season and she was very pleased. The shoes are bright, which made it easy to spot her clear across the track: I just looked for her shoes when she was with her teammates in uniform and she was easy to spot. The shoes were very light, not heavy at all, which made them perfect for her to run in.
463	For normal shoes, I am a size 7.5. I always wear size 8 for Saucony trainers, and 8.5 for Saucony spikes and XC spikes, but for these, they are really thin so I got 8 and that was perfect.
464	good quality for cost!
465	Daughter loves them
466	My 12 year old daughter really likes this shoe. She said it is comfortable and fits very well. Someone else really likes it too since they stole her first pair lol!
467	Not wide enough for my own feet.  Nicely made product though.
468	good quality
469	I only received one side of this shoes.need the other side.need the left.
470	Perfect. I let my daughter pick. I ordered a 1/2 size up as recommended. I probably could of gone a full size up. But my daughter has a narrow foot and I was afraid her foot would “flop out”. So we will pay the extra and go up a size as needed. If your child as a more average size foot, I would say you could size up at least 1/2-full size if they are on the cusp of that growth spurt. If your child has a wide foot, I do not recommend these shoes. Again-this is MY OPINION. I feel has been very fair and honest.
471	In the picture it shows laces. What I received was Velcro!  Twice!!!! Not happy
472	Not as described, what made these look so undesirable was the fact that they came with a giant velcro strap across the top. THIS STRAP WAS NOT IN THE PHOTO. So I feel I was fooled. They look like old men  shoe. SAD!
473	My son was excited for these shoes. Unlike others, I WAS looking for velcro, because although he knows how to tie his shoes, he would rather slip them on and off, and I would rather still have a decent, rather then broken heel of his shoe. Turns out the heel was not the problem!! Instead, the toe part (it is cloth-woven on top of a more solid base) of the shoe began to unravel a couple months into wear, and now it looks completely frayed (over an inch or so) and tacky, revealing the plastic form of the shoe underneath. Otherwise the shoe has held up great, the white part in the front is fine, the tread on the bottom, it fits, he loves it, etc, but he will be getting a new pair of a DIFFERENT shoe, because I am not taking my chances on this pair again.
474	These shoes are wonderful Adidas quality, but as others have stated, the item description is incorrect.  I ordered the royal blue color with laces, and received a velcro closure. It's otherwise a fantastic shoe, and the velcro closes all the way across, and stays shut. I think my son (almost 10) is just about too old to velcro, he disagrees so we're keeping them.  But I'll choose a different style next time.
475	After being loyal to UA and Nike shoes for kids, I've recently dabbled in purchasing some Adidas shoes and am pleasantly surprised by their comfort and quality.  They tend to run slightly bigger and more true to size than Nike, which run small, and are better quality than UA which tend to wear quickly and have color wear off.  The Adidas are really the best if both Nike and UA with sizing and quality.  These are lightweight, attractive and fit well.  These are nice kids shoes and worthy of five stars.
476	This shoe doesn't actually have the velcro strap, as it appears to have in the product image.If your child is like mine and not the best at tying their shoes yet, then you know that the velcro strap really comes in handy (which is the main reason why I selected this shoe to purchase), so needless to say, I was pretty disappointed that the product image was inaccurate.Other than that though, it's a good shoe and we decided to go ahead and keep it and continue perfecting our shoe-tying skills.
477	They fit great! But we had these shoes for a month before they started falling apart. My son is 5. I bought these because two kids in my son's daycare ages 1 and 3 have these shoes and they're adorable. However, after a month they started falling apart. The toe part now looks like a dog started eating them. Its so sad especially for the price. Walmart shoes may have been a better bet for quality.
478	"I am a 73 year old Breast Cancer Survivor almost 9 years only 4' 11"" tall and wear children size shoes 3-1/2 XW.  Was thrilled when I found a pink shoe in the Big Kids Size that fit me perfectly.  It has extra depth so I can insert my Alegria insole protecting my feet that no longer have muscle due to chemo side affect.  Thank you for having this amazing shoe just right and comfortable for me when I walk or go to my Cancer Survivor Exercise Class!!"
479	I've been buying new balance shoes for several years for my kids.  The new v4 of the 990's is just not good.  The quality has gone down, the fit is different and the shoes are completely falling apart in less than 2 months.  Stitching is coming out, hole in mesh on top of shoe, etc.  What's really shameful is that the cost of these v4's went up so much compared to the v3's.  When the quality comes back I'll reconsider.
480	I think that the shoes are really nice, but I ordered the light grey 990 V4 in the size that my son normally wears and the shoes were like a half of a size 2 small (length). I went back to order the next size up and they were sold out. I ended up ordering the NB 888 in dark grey (Magnet) and they are even nicer with better support than the newer version 990.
481	DISGUSTING! I cannot even believe someone would pack these nasty shoes and pass them off as a new. Returning!
482	These are the ONLY tennis shoes my 5 year old can wear.  He has a wide foot with a large instep and he has trouble getting his feet in shoes.  These shoes are great because they come in a WIDE and EXTRA WIDE.  We bought the extra wide and they fit him perfectly and were super comfortable.
483	The shoes were really nice. I loved the color and how they looked on my sons foot. They fit exactly and the goal was to get them in a bigger size but the size was unavailable. I will purchase them again in a larger size for later as he grows. They were tremendous with issuing my refund. I did not like having to pay for shipping as part of my refund but the shoes were incredibly inexpensive so no complaints here.
484	Very nice quality and look. My child is very particular about her shoes and needs a wide space for her toes. These extra wide shoes are perfect. Couldn't find any other shoe out there to meet her needs.
485	Fast shipping. The shoe colors are off. The soles are thinner than the original 990. Not as much support. Emailed the support team about my concern but they never responded back. Returning the product.
486	My foot doctor explained that the shoes are built so that they tilt inward in the heel area as most people walk this way.  Huh?  That's just plain nuts.  Secondly, the gray pair I bought a few months ago--same shoe--the back of the heel area--not the bottom of the shoe--has compressed after 3 weeks of wear.  After spending $80 on this New Balance 990 shoe, it's unwearable.  What a waste of my money.  We'll see how these new ones wear.  I'm not holding my breath.
487	Seems to be a comfortable supportive shoe. As an adult female who still has to wear kid's shoes, I have a very hard time finding anything appropriate to wear. I hope New Balance continues to make at least one or two styles that are not pink and sparkly!
488	I love it, I love it. Wouldn't mind buying other colors.
489	I am always on the lookout for sporty shoes that I can slip on and don't have to wear socks with. It's not an easy find. With that said, these shoes are sporty and quite cute. They look almost knit and the gray color is a nice neutral. I was really pleased with how the shoe looked.In addition to a cute shoe, I require a decent amount of arch support (I love Vionic shoes). I purchased these because of all of the reviews noting these had great arch support. I have one question.....Where is said arch support? If you are expecting a decent amount of arch support (like a Vionic shoe) - this is NOT it. The insole has a bit of bump - else it's pretty flat without a lot of padding. I was super disappointed in how flimsy the insole was. The good thing is the insole is removable, so if you love the shoe and need more support - you can easily add your own insole.
490	I purchased this pair of Ryka ballet flats to replace a pair I bought a couple of years ago that I had worn out.  They are so incredibly comfortable and are the perfect flat to wear when you need to be a little more shoe than a pair of sneakers but not dragging out a pair of heels!
491	I really like the Ryka black flat with a black sole.  No more clown feet with those big white rubber bumpers.  Shoe is comfortable in every way I appreciate...fit, style, lightweight and flexible, breathable fabric, and looks attractive with all of my pants and capris.  True to size in a size 10W... even a little room to wiggle my toes.
492	I have several pairs of Ryka, all size 6.5.  I love the brand. These were huge in the heel area and a bit wide across the bridge of my foot. Before you ask I double checked to make sure they had not sent me the 6.5 Wide. It is stamped 6.5 M.  I am so disappointed because they are just what I needed. I do not think the size 6 would be any better due to the width.
493	Absolute Comfort is what first comes to mind with these.  With these available in a Wide width it made for a perfect fit at 6 1/2 W.  These will be my go to slip ons for around the house, no break in needed.  I love them, it is like they were made for my foot!!
494	I ordered this in black and came back for two more colors.  I wear a size 9 and it was a full size 9 with a little room.  It is not narrow or tight, which I like.  I have been looking for comfy flats for awhile and Ryka got it right.
495	I ordered these in a 7.5 wide and they fit my wide foot comfortably. I do not notice any arch supports. I like these shoes. It is hard to find cute shoes for a wide foot. They are comfortable for a short term wear however I have not tried wearing them for super long periods of time so I cannot attest to how they feel after wearing for a whole day.
496	These shoes are comfortable out of the box. I've been wearing them almost everyday since receiving them. When they get dirty, I toss them in the washer on delicate cycle and then air dry.
497	I bought these for my son and I was hoping they would be a good choice for the winter weather.  He likes them but one issue is that they're not comfortable for all day wearing.
498	Returned them. Too stiff and narrow for an athletic tween.
499	Awesome boots
500	Cool
